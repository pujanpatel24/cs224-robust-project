Ten inches of rain may be enough for many plants to survive if the rain is spread throughout the year. If it falls within one or two months and the rest of the year is dry, those plants may die and a desert may form. Sand begins as tiny pieces of rock that get smaller and smaller as wind and weather wear them down. Sand dunes are formed as winds move the sand across the desert. Bit by bit, the dunes grow over the years, always moving with the winds and changing the shape. Most of them are only a few feet tall, but they can grow to be several hundred feet high. There is, however, much more to a desert than sand. In the deserts of the southwestern United States, cliffs and deep valleys were formed from thick mud that once lay beneath a sea more than millions of years ago. Over the centuries, the water dried up. Wind, sand, rain, heat and cold all wore away at the remaining rocks. The faces of the desert mountains are always changing--very, very slowly--as these forces of nature continue to work on the rock. Most deserts have a surprising variety of life. There are plants, animals and insects that have adapted to life in the desert. During the heat of the day, a visitor may see very few signs of living things, but as the air begins to cool in the evening, the desert comes to life. As the sun begins to rise again in the sky, the desert once again becomes quiet and lonely.", "Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Third WheelBy Jeff Kinney A dance at Greg Heffley's middle school is going to be held, but he can't find someone to go with him.

United Kingdom Celebrations for Spring Festival in the UK started in 1980, with the first evening party held in 2002. Every new year, people get together and have a lot of activities. They sing songs, dance to music, share photos with friends or enjoy films in a cinema. United States Spring Festival has become a key time for Chinese living or working in the US. They join in a large evening party to welcome the traditional new year. It is a good chance for people to build a circle of friends and feel that they are not alone because they share the same culture and values. Australia The Chinese new year will be welcomed with three weeks of celebrations across Australia. Many people come to Sydney's Chinatown or Little Bourke in Melbourne. They enjoy fireworks, lion dances, dragon boat races and many other traditional activities. The celebrations are also a bridge towards better understanding between Chinese and non-Chinese. Singapore The family dinner on new year's eve is an important tradition for Chinese whether they were born in Singapore or moved there from China. They place traditional food on a table as an act of remembering their past. Then the whole family enjoy their dinner together. They usually hold it at home because having it in a restaurant takes away the meaning of the tradition.", "Televisions were among the most talked about items at the 2013 International Consumer Electronics Show last week in Las Vegas, Nevada. Some employed the most advanced technology ever. Some of the TVs used a new technology called Organic Light Emitting Diodes, or OLED. They were thinner, lighter, offered better color1 and were brighter than traditional LEDs. Smart TVs this year were smarter. Many offered technology that let users have a more personalized experience. One such TV from the electronics company TCL uses sensors and voice recognition to determine who is watching. It then offers programming based on the specific user. Another TV from Panasonic offers a similar personalized user experience. In addition to television technology, size also played a major part in CES 2013. Televisions varied in size from big to bigger, with at least two companies -- Samsung and HiSense -- exhibiting TVs measuring 110 inches. The yearly Consumer Electronics Show is the biggest technology trade show in North America and one of the biggest in the world. Gary Shapiro is president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, the group that organizes CES. He gave one of the keynote speeches on opening day. \"Now you know that CES is more than a trade show. It's a gathering of the brightest minds and the top leaders from many industries and those seeking a glimpse into the future.\" That glimpse into the future included a look at digital health and fitness devices, which were also big at CES 2013. There were devices that track your activity and others that measure blood pressure, heart rate and weight. There was even a fork that tells you when you are eating too fast. Cars, smart-phones, tablet computers and PCs also made news. And a 27-inch table computer drew quite a bit of attention. CEA President Gary Shapiro says there was much to see but not nearly enough time to see it all. \"You cannot see the show in the four days that you have. We have over 3200 different industries showing over 20,000 new products. It's ly incredible.\"", "A time capsule buried by Apple founder Steve Jobs 30 years ago has been discovered after its location was long forgotten.In 1983, the young tech innovator was attending a conference in Aspen when he and the group decided to bury as a stunt during a design convention. The tube that was filled with an eclectic collection of goods- ranging from the then-new apple mouse to a six-pack of beer for the people who discovered the time capsule- was meant to be dug up 20 years later. There was a problem with that plan, however, as everyone involved forgot where it was buried. The final discovery happened at the hands of the crew from the National Geographic Channel`s reality show called Diggers.The discovery was well documented and is surely going to be featured on an upcoming episode, and even the experts had problems finding this particular treasure. CNET reports that in spite of their preparations and clear idea of where the 13-foot-long tube was, it still took them two hours to dig it up using heavy machinery. To anyone removed from the tech industry, the accomplishment in finding the tube appears to be the biggest accomplishment. To others, the most interesting object would likely be the `Lisa` mouse placed in the tube by the hands of a then-28-year-old Jobs.The Lisa Mouse, which Jobs named after his daughter, was one of the first commercial computer mice soled publicly, making it a rarity at the time. The Aspen Historical Society is going to help the show creators catalogue the tube`s contents- but no word yet whether or not the Diggers cracked open one of the six bottles of Boddington`s Ale that was left inside for the people who found the tube.", "For hundreds of years, Japan has been hit, from time to time, by tsunamis , which are caused by earthquakes or underwater volcanoes. The story of the boy Yuuki is the story of such a disaster. Yuuki lived with his family in a seaside village, below a small mountain. One day, as he played on top of the mountain, Yuuki felt a small earthquake but it was not strong enough to frighten anybody. Soon after, however, Yuuki noticed the sea darken and begin running away from the shore very fast, leaving behind wide areas of beach that had never been seen before. Yuuki remembered reading that just before a terrible tsunami, the sea suddenly and quickly rolls backward. He ran to the beach, warning the villagers who had gathered to admire the new beach land. But no one listened. They laughed at him and continued playing in the new sand. Desperate, Yuuki could think of only one thing to do. He lit a tree branch, raced to the rice fields and began burning the harvested rice. Then he called out, \"Fire! Fire! Everyone run to the mountain! Now!\" When everyone reached the mountain top, a villager cried out, \"Yuuki is mad! I saw him set the fire.\" Yuuki hung his head in shame, but said nothing as the villagers screamed at him. Just then, someone shouted, \"Look!\" In the distance a huge dark wave of water was speeding towards the shore. When it hit the shore, it destroyed everything. On the mountain everyone stared at the village ruins in terror. \"I'm sorry I burned the fields,\" said Yuuki, his voice trembling. \"Yuuki,\" the village chief answered. \"You saved us all.\" The villagers cheered and raised Yuuki into the air. \"We were going to celebrate our rice harvest tonight,\" said one, \"but now we'll celebrate that we're all still alive!\"", "Convenient location 5 minutes from Washington ,D.C. and one block to Crystal City METRO ,Crystal City Underground.

Pete used to spend his holidays travelling the world, visiting the pyramids in Egypt or scuba diving in the Caribbean. Nowadays he prefers to spend his holidays and weekends making his house look more beautiful. Like hundreds of thousands of other British people, he has discovered the joy of DIY (Do It Yourself), which means if there are any things that need fixing around the house, he will try to do the job himself. As he showed me the new kitchen he put together by himself and the newly painted walls, I asked Pete where he got his inspiration from. He told me that his favorite source of ideas was a DIY program on TV. This got me thinking about the great popularity of DIY programs in the UK. Each major channel has at least one home or garden improving show and there's even a satellite channel completely about the subject. I guess it is not really surprising that DIY programs are so popular. Two common sayings in Britain- 'an Englishman's home is his castle' and 'there's no place like home'-show how important our houses are to us. With the present economic downturn, many people can't afford to buy a bigger house so they are looking at how they can make their house better without spending a lot of money. DIY is the perfect choice. But be careful! I read a report that said over 230,000 people were injured while doing home improvements in the UK in just one year, including 41,000 who fell off ladders and 5,800 who were seriously hurt by hammers. So I won't be going down to the hardware store.", "According to the latest research in the United States,men and women talk such different languages that it is like people from two different cultures trying to communicate.Professor Deborah Tannen of Georgetown University has noticed the difference in the style of boys' and girls' conversations from an early age.She says that little girls' conversation is less definite than boys' and expresses more doubts.Little boys use conversations to establish status with their listeners.

Mr Lootah's approach is unlikely to be copied widely,but mayors of other big cities around the world are starting to think about taking severe actions of their own,including complete car bans in inner cities.But the efforts may not be enough to reduce traffic and pollution.The problems will only get worse:the number of vehicles sold globally each year will grow from around 80 million today to more than 100 million by the end of the decade,according to IHS Automotive.[] There are already a handful of car-free communities around the world.But these are typically small and often tourist destinations that seek to create a throwback in time,such as Sark Island,in the English Channel.The largest ear-free urban area is probably Venice,where it is impossible to build roads and bridges to link the more than 100 small islands the city sits on. Yet pedestrian malls and other car-free zones keep popping up in cities around the world.Some cities are considering ways to limit central city access to\"green\"machines,such as battery-electric vehicles.Hamburg is perhaps the furthest along.

The author was Agatha Christie, a gentle married lady and one of the most successful writers of detective stories in the world. ks5u In June 1977 , a baby girl became seriously ill in Qatar , near Sandi Arabia . Doctors were unable to find out the cause of her illness, so she was flown to London and sent to Hammersmith Hospital. A team of doctors hurried to examine the baby only to discover that they, too, were puzzled by the very unusual signs of illness. While they were having a discussion about the baby's illness, a nurse asked to speak to them. \"Excuse me,\" said Nurse Marsha Maitland, \"but I think the baby is suffering from thallium poisoning .\" \"What makes you think that?\" Dr. Brown asked. \"Thallium poisoning is very rare.\" \"A few days ago, I was reading a novel called 'A Pale Horse' by Agatha Christie,\" Nurse Maitland explained. \"In the book, somebody uses thallium poison, and all the signs are exactly the same as the baby' s . \" \"You are very careful and you may be right,\" another doctor said. \"we'll carry out some tests and find out whether it' s thallium or not.\" Tests showed that the baby had indeed been poisoned by thallium. Once they knew the cause of the illness, the doctors were able to give the baby the correct treatment. She soon recovered and was sent back to Qatar. Later on it was proved that the poison might have come from an insecticide used in Qatar.", "Our planet was born some billions of years ago. Ever since this planet has developed, it has surprised us human beings. No matter how much we human beings have developed technologically, we cannot ever create this kind of natural planet. The human race can only discover some amazing facts about it. Let us find out what some of them are. On September 13, 1922 El Azizia, a place in Libya, recorded a temperature of 136 degrees Fahrenheit. This was the highest temperature ever measured on the planet Earth. The highest waterfall in the world is Angel Falls in Venezuela, which drops from an amazing height of 3,212 feet. The waterfall drops over the edge of Auyantepui in the Canaima National Park. The gravitational pull of the Earth can be escaped if someone moves at a speed of 6.95 miles per second. At such a speed, one could travel from New York to Philadelphia in just 20 seconds. If the entire water in the world's oceans evaporated, the salt we got from these oceans could cover the entire planet with a 500-foot deep layer of salt. The deepest lake on Earth is Lake Baikal in Russia. Lake Baikal is the largest freshwater lake in the world, containing about 20% of the world's unfrozen surface fresh water. The Andes in South America spreads over 4,525 miles. This is the longest mountain range in the world. Did you know that the biggest valley in the world is the Grand Valley in Mesa County, Colorado and Grand County, Utah? It is about 30 miles (48 km) long and 5 miles (8 km) wide, along the Colorado River. The amazing facts about the earth are too many to be told completely above.", "Not so long ago almost student who successfully completed a university degree could find a good career quite easily. However. those days are gone, even in Hong Kong, and nowadays graduates often face strong competition in the search for jobs. Job seekers first have to make a careful assessment of their own abilities. One area of assessment should be of their academic qualifications, which would include special skills within their subject area. Graduates should also consider their own personal values and attitudes, or the importance to themselves of such matters as money, security, leadership and caring for others. The second stage is to study the opportunities available for employment. Job application forms and letters should, of course, be filled in carefully and correctly, without grammar or spelling errors. When graduates are asked to attend for interview, they should prepare properly by finding out all they can about the prospective employer. Dressing suitably and arriving for the interview on time are also obviously important. Interviewees should try to give positive and helpful answers and should not be afraid to ask questions about anything they are unsure about. This is much better than pretending to understand a question and giving an unsuitable answer. It is true that it is hard to find a good job. But there will always be good career opportunities for people with ability, skills and determination; the secret to securing good jobs in to be one of them.", "Like the Five Olympic Rings from which they draw their color and inspiration, the Five Friendlies will serve as the Official Mascots of Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, carrying a message of friendship and peace and blessings from China to children all over the world. Designed to express the playful qualities of five little children who form an intimate circle of friends, the Five Friendlies also embody the natural characteristics of four of China's most popular animals--the Fish, the Panda, the Tibetan Antelope, the Swallow--and the Olympic Flame. Each of the Friendlies has a rhyming two-syllable name--a traditional way of expressing affection for children in China. Beibei is the Fish, Jingjing is the Panda, Huanhuan is the Olympic Flame, Yingying is the Tibetan Antelope and Nini is the Swallow. When you put their names together--Bei Jing Huan Ying Ni--they say \"Welcome to Beijing,\" offering a warm invitation that reflects the mission of the Five Friendlies as young ambassadors for the Olympic Games. The Five Friendlies also embody both the landscape and the dreams and aspirations of people from every part of the vast country of China. In their origins and their headpieces, you can see the five elements of nature--the sea, forest, fire, earth and sky--all stylistic rendered in ways that represent the deep traditional influences of Chinese folk art and ornamentation.", "An old farmer lived on a farm with his young grandson. Each morning Grandpa was up early to read his Bhagavat Geeta. His grandson wanted to be just like him and tried to imitate him in every way he could. One day the grandson asked, \"Grandpa! I try to read the Bhagavat Geeta just like you but I don't understand it, What good does reading the Bhagavat Geeta do?\" The Grandfather quietly turned from putting coal in the stove and replied, \"Take this coal basket down to the river and bring me back a basket of water.\" The boy did as he was told, but all the water leaked out before he got back to the house. The grandfather laughed and said, \"You'll have to move a little faster next time,\" and sent him back to the river with the basket to try again. This time the boy ran faster, but again the same took place. He told his grandfather that it was impossible to carry water with a basket. The old man said, \" You're just not trying hard enough,\" So the boy again dipped the basket into the river and ran hard, but when he reached his grandfather the basket was again empty. he said, \"See Grandpa, it's useless!\" \"So you think it is useless?\" The old man said, \"Look at the basket.\" The boy looked at the basket and for the first time realized that the basket was different. It had been transformed from a dirty old coal basket into a clean one inside and outside. \"You might not understand or remember everything, but when you read it, you will be changed, inside and out.

Today my friends show off the more unpleasant aspects of their personalities via FaceBook. No longer hidden, they're thrown in my face like TV commercials -unavoidable and endless advertisements for the worst of their personalities. Take Fred. If you were to have lunch with him, you'd find him warm, and self-effacing .Read his FaceBook and you'll realize he's an unbearable, food-obsessed boring man.

Is it the Fred I can grab a sandwich with or the Fred who weeps if he's at a party and the wine isn't up to his standard?", "J.K. Rowling had reused her magic and brought Dumbledore back to life. A spokesperson for the author confirmed Rowling had sent a letter and a package to a Texas teenager who optimistically found strength in the words of a Harry Potter film after witnessing the murder of her family. Fifteen-yiear-old Cassidy Stay lost both parent s and four _ to a gunman in Texas last month. Cassidy was shot in the head and survived the gunshot wound only because she played dead. Authorities had called her survival a miracle. Cassidy had seen the unimaginable tragedy, but was still thinking about happiness. At the memorial( ) for her family, Cassidy gave a speech in front of the media saying she believed her family was \"in a much better place.\" Quoting the words of Dumbledore, the wise headmaster of Hogwarts, she said, \"Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.\" The same day Cassidy gave her speech, a Facebook page called \"We want J.K. Rowling to meet Cassidy Stay\" formed and quickly draw public attention. The creator of the page claimed to know a friend of Cassidy's who \"confirmed that J.K. Rowling did write Cassidy a personal letter under the name of 'Dumbledor'. She also sent a wand, an acceptance letter to Hogwarts with a school supply list, along with the 3rdbook with Rowling's autograph.\"", "His name was Fleming, and he was a poor Scottish farmer. One day, while trying to make a living for his family, he heard a cry for help coming from a nearby bog. He dropped his tools and ran to the bog. There, tapped to his waist in black mud, was a terrified boy, screaming and struggling to free himself. Farmer Fleming saved the boy from what could have been a slow and terrifying death. The next day, a fancy carriage pulled up to the Scotsman' s surroundings. An elegantly dressed nobleman stepped out and introduced himself as the father of the boy Farmer Fleming had saved. \"I want to repay you,\" said the nobleman. \"You saved my son' s life.\" \"No, I can' t accept payment for what I did,\" the Scottish farmer replied, waving off the offer. At that moment, the farmer' s own son came to the door of the family hovel . \"Is that your son?\" the nobleman asked. \"Yes, \"the farmer replied proudly. \"I' ll make you a deal. Let me take him and give him a good education. If the boy is anything like his father, he' ll grow to a man you can be proud of.\" And that he did. In time, Farmer Fleming' s son graduated from St. Mary' s Hospita l Medical School in London, and went on to become known throughout the world as the noted Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. Years afterward, the nobleman' s son was stricken with pneumonia . What saved him? Penicillin. The name of the nobleman? Lord Randolph Churchill. His son' s name? Sir Winston Churchill.

I had a lot of fun reading it and thinking of as many differences as I could as an American. Their cars have \"bonnets \", while ourselves have \"hoods\". They park their cars in a \"car park\" while we leave ours in a \"parking lot\". Our \"cookies\" are their \"biscuits\", while their \"rubbers\" are our \"erasers\". Then there are the food words. Would you want to eat something called \"Toad in the Hole\" or \"Bangers and Mash\" or \"Spotted Dick\"? I'm here to report they are all very tasty. There are American equivalents ,of course. We've got \"Shoofly Pie\", \"Chicken Fried Steak\" and \"Mississippi Mud Pie\". What they call \"crisps\" is what we call \"potato chips\" and when we ask for \"chips\" in England we will get what we know at home in America as \"French fries\". They find it _ that we call the \"toilet\" the \"bathroom\" and they really double over with laughter when we ask for the \"restroom\". American ladies in England who ask for the \"little girl's room\" or the \"powder room\" will be met with blank stares. A \"fag\" is a \"cigarette\" in the UK, which can lead to endless confusion for British visitors looking for a cigarette in America. Americans on the other hand are endlessly confused by English signs put up over doorways saying \"Way Out\". We Americans walk on the sidewalk not the pavement. \"Pavement\" in America is the actual cement the sidewalk is made of.", "What Is Bird Flu? What is bird flu?It's a form of influenza believed to strike all birds.Though poultry are believed to be especially prone to humans,no human-to-human transmission has been reported. Where is it?Thailand,Vietnam,Indonesia,Cambodia,South Korea,Japan,Taiwan and China have reported outbreaks in birds in recent months.Thailand and Vietnam have reported human cases.Bird flu was first reported in humans in Hong Kong in 1997.Since then,it's popped up mostly in Asia,although the Netherlands reported an outbreak,including human cases,in 2003. How many people have been affected?The disease has killed seven people.Vietnam has confirmed six human cases,and all of them have died.Thailand has confirmed three cases,including one death. How is it passed?Infected birds spread the virus through saliva ,faeces ,and nasal secretions . So far,only humans with direct contact with sick birds have caught the disease.But scientists are worried that bird flu could link with regular human influenza,mutate ,and become a deadly new virus and cause a pandemic . What are the symptoms in birds?Loss of appetite,ruffled feathers,fever,weak- ness,diarrhea ,excessive thirst,swelling.Mortality rate can range between 50 percent to 100 percent. What are the symptoms in humans?Fever,cough,sore throat,muscle aches,eye infections,pneu- monia ,viral pneumonia and so on. World Health Organization(WHO) says this year's strain is resistant to cheaper antiviral drugs,for instance,amantadine(,).Scientists are exploring more expensive treatment. WHO also recommends quarantining sick people. There's no evidence that the virus is being passed through eating chicken products,health experts say.Heat kills viruses,and WHO says chicken products should be cooked thoroughly at the temperature of at least 70 degrees Celsius(158 degrees Fahrenheit).WHO also says people should wash their hands after handling poultry so as not to contaminate other objects.", "Edward Wilson is America's, if not the world's, leading naturalist. In The Future of Life, he takes us on a tour of the world's natural resources. How are they used? What has been lost? What remains and is it able to continue with the present speed of use? Wilson also points out the need to understand fully the biodiversity of our earth. Wilson begins with an open letter to the pioneer in environment protection, Henry David Thoreau. He compares today's Walden Pond with that of Thoreau's day. Wilson will use such comparisons for the rest of the book. The problem is clear: man has done great damage to his home over the years. Can the earth, with human help, be made to return to biodiversity levels that will be able to support us in the future? Biodiversity, Wilson argues, is the key to settling many problems the earth faces today. Even our agricultural crops can gain advantages from it. A mere hundred species are the basis of our food supply, of which but twenty carry the load. Wilson suggests changing this situation by looking into ten thousand species that could be made use of, which will be a way to reduce the clearing of the natural homes of plants and animals to enlarge farming areas. At the end of the book, Wilson discusses the importance of human values in considering the environment. If you are to continue to live on the earth, you may as well read and act on the ideas in this book.", "Bright, Spacious Room Spacious, single furnished room in owner- occupied home is available now, for one and a half years.

The Fineck device aims to address neck pain by tracking tiny movement, spotting bad habits and suggesting exercises via an accompanying app. Made from silicone and titanium , Fineck monitors a wearer's movement, balance, posture and movement thanks to sensors inside. The Mountain View California-based firm says that a high percentage of people suffer from neck pain and associated problems, probably caused by more individuals doing office jobs, which generally involve leaning over computer keyboard. The device contains sensors, several different types of instruments to monitor movement, plus a monitor to shake. It connects to an IOS app via Bluetooth so that wearers can see their bad habits and play \"neck training\" games. The app warns of health risks and records a user's activity to build up a customer personal health description. The necklace shakes to give smart advice, such as reminding wearers to sit up straight. The app also allows users to set goals, like many other wearables do. \"Fineck is the first wearable device for your neck that tracks your neck activity and warn you when you are in a bad posture for too long. You can also exercise your neck with Fineck's interactive games.\" The company writes on Kickstarter. \"No matter where you are and what you are doing at office, on the go, or simply just feeling bored, Fineck will bring you enriched exercise experience through motion sensing games and therapies.\" It also claims that it is \"the world's first titanium wearable device\". The metal is widely used in fashion stuff that you can wear or carry to match your clothes because it is lightweight, durable and does not tend to cause allergic reactions. It also offers additional features such as shaking to indicate alerts on a user's smartphone, but it is not currently clear whether it can also be used like bands, to count steps, and so on. The Fineck has a battery life of around seven days and takes one hour to charge. It is available to pre-order via Kickstarter from $69(PS44)and is due to ship in March next year.", "Garden of small inventions Visitors of all ages are invited to Port Discovery to see the new exhibit--a garden of small inventions, which features interactive activities and gadgets(,,) for the environmental protection.

People travel abroad for medical treatment for various reasons:it's cheaper,they face a long wait at home,or the treatment they want is not available in their own country.The Britishbased Medical Tourist Company refers about 100 patients a year to hospitals in India for treatments.And Chief Executive Premhar Shah reports rapid growth in demand from customers in Africa,where it can be harder to find wellequipped medical facilities for complex surgeries. Some patients who have immigrated may prefer to return to be close to their families when they undergo surgery.\"People will want to take the opportunity to seek treatment in places where they have relatives who might be able to look after them.I'm seeing that especially with younger people from eastern Europe,\" said a professor at the University of Oxford. For some,there is the attraction of free treatment abroad.British lawmakers have called for tighter checks on patients arriving for treatment,out of concerns that foreign citizens are travelling to Britain to take advantage of the free service. The global medical tourism market is believed to be worth $40 billion to $60 billion and growing at about 20 percent per year.", "There are some strange driving laws in different countries. Vietnam: If you're in Vietnam without a Vietnamese driver's license, you risk a prison sentence of up to 3years. Russia: In Moscow, if your car is dirty enough to draw dust art, you will be fined about 2,000 rubles. Worse yet, it's not legal to wash your car by hand in public places--forcing you to take it to one of the few car wash facilities. Thailand: Drivers--males or females--can't drive shirtless, whether it's a car, a bus or a tuk-tuk. France: France requires its drivers to carry a potable breathalyzer all the time when driving a car. The one-time breathalyzer cost around US $ 5, and if you don't have one, you will be fined US $ 15. Cyprus: Raising your hands in the car can get you fined of US $ 35. The law states a driver can be fined if the person is not in a regular position inside the car or raises his hands from the steering wheel unnecessarily. Japan: Politeness isn't just the culture in Japan; it's part of driving laws. Splashing a person by driving through a puddle with your car will cost you over US $ 60.

One loyal friend is worth ten thousand relatives. Friends are very rare jewels, indeed. They make you smile and encourage you to succeed. On the first Sunday in August, it's time to recognize your friends and their contribution to your life. The first Sunday in August was fixed as National Friendship Day by the U.S. Congress in 1935, and remains a tradition observed in many countries and cultures. In 1997, the United Nations named Winnie the Pooh as the world's Ambassador of Friendship. Apparently, there are several friendship holidays, all of which fall on fixed dates. National Friendship Day is on the first Sunday in August Women's Friendship Day is on the third Sunday in September International Friendship Month is February Old Friends, New Friends Week is the third week of May People show their appreciation for friendship in various ways. Some expressions may be practical ones, such as flowers, particularly the pink friendship roses, cookies, chocolates, souvenirs from their vacations, a tape of favorite songs, farewell dinners, and welcome balloons. Recipe for Friendship 2 cups of patience, 1 heart full of love, 2 handfuls of generosity, 2 cups of loyalty, 1 cup of understanding, A dash of laughter. Mix them all well. Spray generously over a lifetime and serve everyone you meet. Friendship helps to bring peace and positivity to the globe, another great reason to celebrate!

Here are some examples of rudeness. Some people prefer to do almost everything over the internet. To them, dealing with an actual human is like an evolutionary step backward. It feels very slow because humans don, t work at 4G speeds. When you have dinner with friends, you will often notice someone paying more attention to his mobile phone. We have programmed ourselves to think that every new message brings life-changing news, so taking calls and checking our texts are more important than talking to the people we are with. What is worse, some people even tend to send anonymous rude messages by email. However, rudeness is never acceptable, Don, t assume it is OK to be rude if the person you, re in touch with won, t recognize you. If you have something awful to say, have the courage to face the person and say it, write a letter or email and sign it, or forget it. Upsetting people with unsigned messages is cruel and disgusting. We shouldn't blame technology for our shortcomings. Technology is here to help us, but we should not allow it to take over our lives. An important step is acknowledging our shortcomings. People spend a lot of time pointing out bad manners but it would be even more help if we'd publicly acknowledge good manners when we see them.", "If you wish to become a better reader, here are four important things to remember about reading _ : * Knowing why you are reading or what you are reading to find out will often help you to know whether to read rapidly or slowly. * Some things should be read slowly throughout. Examples are directions for making or doing something, arithmetic problems, science and history books, which are full of important information. You must read such things slowly to remember each important step and understand each important ideas. * Some things should be read rapidly throughout. Examples are simple stories meant for enjoyment, news letters from friends, pieces of news from local, or home-town, papers, telling what is happening to friends and neighbors. * In some of your reading, you must change your speed from fast to slow and slow to fast, as you go along. You will need to read certain pages rapidly and then slow down and do more careful reading when you come to important ideas which must be remembered.", "It seems that great artists and scientists often suffer from mental problems. Both Einstein and Dickens had mental illness. Now scientists have started to look at whether mental illness and genius are linked . Dr. Adele Juda studied 5,000 creative people in Germany. She found there were more people with mental illness in this group than in the general population. Poets had the highest rate of mental illness, followed by musicians, with lower numbers for painters and architects. Other scientists did research which also showed a strong link between mental problems and creativity. But, it did nothing to explain it. Dr. Ruth Richards of Harvard University _ . Instead of studying creative people, she took a group of psychiatric patients and tested them for creativity. The patients got much higher scores than a normal group. Also, the patients' close relatives were much more creative than the patients and a normal group. This suggests that the key to the link between creativity and mental illness is in our genes . But this is a problem. According to Darwinism, harmful genes should be removed. Some scientists believe that evolution has created a balance, where the madness of a few people leads to the development of the whole human race. Geniuses may be mad, bad or just difficult to understand, but their discoveries have improved the world we live in. It seems that a little creative madness is good for us all.", "South Asia heatwave kills nearly 100 DHAKA - A heat wave sweeping India, Bangladesh and Nepal has killed nearly 100 people over the past two weeks, officials said on June 3, 2005.

The biggest change to the SAT will be the introduction of a new writing section. The writing section will consist of two parts: an essay and a multiple-choice section. Students will be given 25 minutes to respond to a prompt and construct a well-organized essay that effectively deals with the task. The essay question may require students to complete a statement, to react to a quote, or to agree or disagree with a point of view. In any case, a good essay will support the chosen position with specific reasons and examples from literature, history, art, science, current affairs, or even a student's own experiences. Essays will be scored based on the procedures for the current SAT II: Writing Test. Essays will be graded by two independent readers On a scale of 1~6, and their two scores will be combined to form an essay subscore that ranges from 2 to 12. Should the readers' scores vary by more than 2 points, a third reader will score the essay; The readers will be high school teachers and college professors who teach composition. To ensure that essays will be scored in a timely manner, they will be scanned and made available to readers on the Internet for grading purpose. The writing section will also include multiple-choice grammar and usage questions. Some of these questions will call upon students to improve given sentences and paragraphs. Others will present students with sentences and require them to identify mistakes in diction , grammar, sentence construction, subject-verb agreement, proper word usage. The highest possible score on the new writing section will be 800. Scores on the essay and multiple-choice section will be combined to produce a single score. A writing subscore will also be assigned.

Do you ever notice the colors of your dreams? Do you dream in black and white or do you dream in yellow, red and green? New research suggests that the type of television you watched as a child has a great effect on the color of your dreams. While almost all people under 25 dream in color, thousands of people over 55, all of whom were brought up with black and white TV sets, often dream in monochrome . \"It suggests there could be a critical period in our childhood when watching films has a big impact on the way dreams are formed\", said Eva Murzyn, a psychology student at Dundee University in Britain who carried out the study. Research from 1915 through the 1950s suggested that the vast majority of dreams are in black and white. But the tide turned in the sixties, and later results suggested that up to 83 percent of dreams contain some color. Since this period also marked the transition between black-and-white film and TV and Technicolor ,an obvious explanation was that the media had been painting people's dreams. However, there weren't any firm conclusions. But now Miss Murzyn believes she has proven the link. She made a survey of more than 60 people, half of whom were over 55 and half of whom were under 25. She asked the volunteers to answer a questionnaire on the color of their dreams and their childhood exposure to film and TV. She then analyzed her own data. Only 4.4 percent of the under-25s' dreams were black and white. The over-55s who had had access to color TV and film during their childhood also reported a very low proportion of just 7.3 percent. But the over-55s who only had access to black-and -white media reported dreaming in black and white about a quarter of the time. Even though they would have spent only a few hours a day watching TV or films, their attention and emotion would have been heightened during this time, leaving a deeper imprint on their mind, Miss Murzyn told the New Scientist. \"The crucial time is between three and ten when we all begin to have the ability to dream\", she said.", "Mr. Eckerd at the end of the street was a different fellow with a different kind of house. He let kids from the neighborhood come to see his house, but only if they had written permission from their parents, and if he'd already spoken to the parents before. What made it so different? He shared his home with rescued animals that the county couldn't keep. He had the permission to have things like monkeys, large cats, and other strange creatures. His house had the ivy -covered brick wall and the iron gate across the driveway. Once you went inside, the hedges lining the driveway were carved into the shapes of animals. There were other pretty plants on the grounds, too. The old brick house held a lot of surprises. The double doors with the lion's head door knockers opened into a large flat entryway. In the wooden board walls all around, there were fish tanks with colorful fishes. The ceilings were painted with scenes of plants and rare animals. Room opened off from there. Continuing down the hall, you came to a large courtyard, which had been caged in, partly open to the sky .A large group of tiny monkeys shook up and down trees. You had to walk through a caged tunnel into other parts of the house. They called out to whoever walked in, hoping for treats of fruits, nuts, and seeds. Behind that, the hall continued to a room full of snakes and lizards. It felt like a desert in that room, so dry and hot. It was not everyone's favorite room, but it certainly was interesting. The final room was actually out back, and definitely not something to miss. It was much like a large glass bird cage or a greenhouse. It was there that you would usually find Mr Eckerd on a bench next to some carvings of jungle animals. He was watching the Bengal tiger that wandered back and forth inside the cage.

Since 2000, the CDC has made efforts with goals of getting 75% of Americans to eat two or more servings of fruit a day and 50% of Americans to eat three or more servings of vegetables a day. Unfortunately, Americans aren't meeting these modest targets. Although a diet high in fruit and vegetables can reduce the risk of many diseases, Americans just aren't getting enough. In fact, since 2000, the amount of vegetables Americans are eating has stayed the same and the amount of fruit Americans are eating has gone down. The CDC also finds that only about a third of adults are eating their expected servings of fruit, and just over a quarter of adults are eating their expected servings of vegetables. So why aren't Americans getting their expected servings of fruit and vegetables? It turns out that Americans might be spoiled when it comes to their produce. A national survey conducted by Fruit2day reveals that nearly half of Americans leave fruit in their fridges until it rots with people in Boston among the worst and those in New York and Los Angeles among the best. Sadly, most Americans admit to leaving fruit in the fridge for more than a week. There are many reasons why Americans don't eat their fruit or vegetables, including the inconvenience of having to wash or peel it. Fruit2day offers consumers a surprising and convenient way to enjoy the goodness of fruit. \"With no added sugar, natural juices and two full servings of fruit, our Fruit2day line has really captured the imaginations of health-conscious consumers who are actively looking to get more fruit in their diets,\" said Hanno Holm, president and chief executive officer of Hero-White Wave. \"Fruit2day makes getting more fruit in one's diet easier for any daily snack routine.\"", "\"Find a job you love, and you'll never work a day in your life.\" Do you agree with this old saying? Joanne Gordon does. She is the author of Be Happy at work and other books about careers . Gordon believes that about 30% of employees in North America do not like their jobs, and she thinks that is terrible. She wants to help people who do not feel satisfied with their jobs find work that is good for them. Joanne says, \"There are no happy jobs, only happy workers.\" She believes that happy workers share three main characteristics. First, happy workers enjoy the daily activities of their jobs, and they look forward to the workday. Take Tony Hawk, for example. At age 14, he became a professional skateboarder. Now he is a businessman working on projects related to skateboarding--films and video games, but he still skates every day. He once said, \"My youngest son's pre-school was recently asked what their dads do for work. My son said, 'I've never seen my dad do work.'\" Tony agrees that his job doesn't look like work. He has found a way to spend each day doing a job he enjoys. Second, happy workers like the people they work with. Sally Ayote says, \"I work with the coolest people in the world.\" She and her group cook for almost 1,200 people in Antarctica. Most of these people are scientists who are doing research. Sally loves to sit and talk with them. She says, \"There is no television here, no radio, so I get to know the scientists and what they're studying.\" Sally thinks she has a great job, and the best part about it is the people. Third, happy workers know that their work helps others. Caroline Baron's work helps people who have had to leave their home countries because of war or other dangers. She is a filmmaker who started an organization called FilmAid, which shows movies in refugee camps around the world. Caroline believes that movies can be very helpful in these camps. For one thing, entertaining movies let refugees forget their troubles for a little while. Movies can also teach important subjects like health and safety. For example, in one camp, thousands of refugees saw a movie about how to get clean water. Caroline knows that is helping other people, and this makes her feel proud and happy about her work. Tony Hawk, Sally Ayote, and Caroline Baron all get great satisfaction from their work. Tony Hawk says, \"Find the thing you love. If you are doing what you love, there is much more happiness there than being rich or famous.\" Joanne Gordon would agree. She encourages people to find something they enjoy doing, find people they like to work with, and find ways to help others. Then they can be proud of what they do, and they will probably be happy at work.", "The TV science-fiction seriesStar Trekno longer looked far-fetched as four men and four women in black space-suits locked themselves into a giant hi-tech greenhouse, known as a 'biosphere', in the Arizona desert yesterday for a two-year study of the environment. As dawn broke over the Santa Catalina mountains, the eight waved goodbye to television cameras. Edward Ross, their multibillionaire sponsor from a Texas oil family, closed the door of the $150 million structure, with its mini-ocean, marsh, desert, savanna, rain-forest and 3,800 plant and animal species designed to allow the team to recreate Earth and its ecosystems. The so-called Biosphere 2 is the latest of a dozen environmental projects started by the self-titled 'ecopreneur'. The project's main aim is to set up a self-sustaining community for possible use in a spaceship or on another planet. The crew members must plant, harvest and process their food on a half-acre farm in the seven-storey glass and metal structure, while conducting a series of experiments. 'We will be custodians of our new little world,' said Abigail Mayer, aged 31, a US marine biologist on the team, her voice choking with emotion. 'It is a brave new step.' Many scientists, however, are more than skeptical. They point out that the largest closed ecosystem which survived more than a few days was smaller than a football. It was developed at the University of Miami and contained only shrimp, algae and other micro-organisms. Critics have also accused Mr. Ross of being more interested in producing a profitable theme park than in carrying out serious scientific research. Hundreds of tourists visited the site daily in the summer before it was occupied by the team. They paid $9.95 to enter and all stopped at the souvenir shop.", "In a time when a dangerous number of people are overweight, many people seem to have forgotten the most important way to keep healthy and slim---exercise. And as a new study carried out on mice in the lab has shown, exercise done early in life can reward you in your adult years. A team of researchers at the University of California studied the effects of early exercise on adult physical activity, body mass and eating. They found that early-age exercise in mice has positive effects on adult levels of voluntary exercise in addition to reducing body mass. \"These results may have an effect on the importance of regular physical education in elementary and middle schools,\" said Theodore Garland, a professor of biology, who led the research project. \"If kids exercise regularly through their school years, then they may be more likely to exercise as adults, which could have far-reaching positive effects on human health and well-being.\" Although the positive effects of early-life exercise lasted for only one week, it is important to note that one week in the life of a mouse is the same as about nine months for humans. \"Our results suggest that any positive effects of early-life exercise on adult exercise will need to be kept up if they are to be long-lasting.\" His team of researchers found, too, that all mice that had access to early exercise were lighter in weight than non-exercised mice. Garland explained that, in general, exercise will stimulate appetite sooner or later. However, it is possible that certain types of exercise, done for certain periods of time or at certain light levels, might not _ appetite much, if at all, at least in some individuals. \"If we could understand what sorts of exercise these might be, then we might be able to tailor exercise recommendations in a way that would bring the benefits of exercise without increase in appetite, leading to a better chance of weight loss,\" he said.", "In a time when a dangerous number of people are overweight, many people seem to have forgotten the most important way to keep healthy and slim---exercise.

Males are much larger than females, measuring 2 to 2.5 meters and weighing 200 to 453 kilograms. Females only measure 1.5 to 2 meters and weigh 50 to 113 kilograms. They can also move fairly well while on land. California sea lions can be found living along the Pacific coast of North America. They prefer to live in waters near rocky and sandy shores. On land, they often gather in large groups as many as 1,000 of them. While at sea, they travel in much smaller groups of around 10 or more. They communicate with one another through a series of sounds. Their diet consists of a wide variety of fish and other sea animals. They are able to hold their breath for up to 10 minutes by slowing down their heart rate, allowing them to hunt for their prey for a longer period of time. They have been known to continuously hunt for up to 30 hours at a time, with their eyesight and hearing playing an important part in finding their food. Being so large, they do not have that many natural predators that they need to be on the lookout for. Eleven months after getting pregnant, the female will give birth to one baby on land. If the baby can survive long enough, they can live to be 20 to 25 years old. California sea lions are not listed as an endangered species. This is largely because of laws such as the US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. Hopefully such acts will continue to show results.", "Cyprus is the third largest island and one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Mediterranean Sea. It attracts over 24 million tourists every year. It gained independence from the UK in 1960. Cyprus is a developed country and has been a member of the European Union since 1 May ,2004. It didn't begin to use the euro until 1 January. 2008. As a tourist destination, Cyprus has clean beaches and fine weather all the year round. There are Roman and Greek ruins on the island, which attract tourists most. You can enjoy skiing and hiking in its huge mountains and charming villages. In the towns and cities, there are some modern hotels, bars and clubs with bright lights and rich nightlife. The story of the island can date back over 10,000 years. Cyprus has long been seen as an important strategic base. Many civilizations have swept through it over the years. In 1974 the Turkish army arrived on the northern coast of Cyprus. They were invited by the Turkish Cypriot leader in order to protect the Turkish villages. Since then the Turkish army took control of the northern third of the island. The Greek Cypriot controlled the other. UN peacekeeping forces kept the peace between the two sides. Although it has political problems, Cyprus is a country that easily links modern European culture with its past. Here, visitors can discover clean beaches, all kinds of grape wine and ancient ruins. With fruit trees around, the old stone villages make tourists feel that modern Europe seems a very long way away indeed.", "The most popular names in the west Every year in Englishspeaking countries,people list the most popular names. Here are some examples. In the United States at the moment the three most popular names for girls are Emily,Emma and Madison. For boys,they are Michael,Joshua and Mathew. In Britain a parent today might call their little girl Grace,Jessica or Ruby. If they have a little boy they could call him Jack,Thomas or Oliver. In China names have very clear meanings. If a girl is called Mei,her name means \"beautiful\". If a boy is called Wu,his name means \"like a soldier\". Names in Englishspeaking countries are like this too. The girl's name Joy is probably partly chosen because the parents wish their daughter to be joyful and bring joy to others. If a girl is called Ruby,it may be because of the beautiful red precious stone. Parents often pick names that can be shortened. This can be confusing for Chinese people. Parents might choose such names because they want to be able to speak to their kid in a personal way. For example,a popular name is William. But William can be shortened to Will,Willy,Bill and Billy. The same is true of the favourite old name for a girl,Elizabeth. Elizabeth can be shortened to Beth,Liza and Liz. Another reason why kids get the names they do is that parents want to name their boy or girl after someone who is famous,such as an actor,a pop music star or a sports star. David is a popular name in Britain,partly because of the fame of the footballer David Beckham.", "I fell in love with England because it was quaint --all those little houses, looking terribly old-fashioned but nice, like dolls' houses. I loved the countryside and the pubs, and I loved London. I've slightly changed my mind after seventeen years because I think it's an ugly town now. Things have changed. For everybody, England meant gentlemen, fair play, and good manners. The fair play is going, unfortunately, and so are the gentlemanly attitudes and good manners--people shut doors heavily in your face and politeness is disappearing. I regret that there are so few comfortable meeting places. You're forced to live indoors. In Paris I go out much more, to restaurants and nightclubs. To meet friends here it usually has to be in a pub, and it can be difficult to go there alone as a woman. The cafes are not terribly nice. As a woman, I feel unsafe here. I spend a bomb on taxis because I will not take public transport after 10 p. m. I used to use _ , but now I'm afraid. The idea of family seems to be more or less non-existent in England. My family is well united and that's typically French. In Middlesex I had a neighbour who is 82 now. His family only lived two miles away, but I took him to France for Christmas once because he was always alone.", "It's no secret that doing good makes others happy - but did you know it can make you happy as well? According to a study, people participating in meaningful activities were happier and felt that their lives had more purpose than people who only engaged in pleasure-seeking behaviors. Try giving these four things to others to start your journey to a happier and healthier lifestyle. 1. Your Time With a busy life, it can be hard to find any time to give away. However, volunteering your time has great benefits, including making new friends and connections, learning new skills and even advancing your career. According to a paper about the link between health and volunteering, volunteering is connected with lower instances of depression and reduces the risk of dying by 22 percent. 2. Your Attention Most of us think we're good listeners, but according to psychologist Paul Donoghue, most people are aware that others don't listen as well as they could. In addition, they're not fully aware that they themselves aren't listening. When practicing mindfulness meditation , you focus on what you experience in the moment and let your thoughts and emotions pass through without judgment. Did you know that giving someone your undivided attention helps you also? When done well, active listening strengthens your focus-which is a major part of good meditation. 3. Your Compassion The psychological meaning of compassion is the ability to understand another person's emotional state. Compassion differs from empathy in that those who experience compassion not only put themselves in another person's shoes, but also want to reduce that person's suffering. A brain-imaging study showed that the brain's pleasure centers are equally active when we give money to the poor as when we receive money ourselves. 4. Your Money According to an experiment, those who spend money on other people are significantly happier than those who spend the same quantity of money on themselves. Whether or not you can offer other gifts, donating money helps make real change happen. It represents time spent, compassion and careful attention to the needs of others.", "A mother of a cheerful five-year-old just returned from a meeting of the National Organization for Women. Inspired by exciting dreams for the possibilities of womanhood, she asked her daughter what she wanted to be when she grew up. Little Lisa quickly answered, \"A nurse.\" There was a time when nursing was thought of as a woman's job and the answer somehow seemed not to be satisfied. She had, after all, just returned from a new meeting. \"You can be anything you want to be,\" she reminded her daughter. \"You can be a lawyer, a doctor, a banker, president of the country -- you can be anything.\" \"Anything?\" Lisa asked. \"Anything!\" her mother smiled. \"I know,\" Lisa said. \"I want to be a horse!\" Lisa's dream may need some improvement, but there is plenty of time for that. When do we give up dreaming about the future? When do we resign ourselves to simply replaying dreams from the past? Maybe her dream needs to mature a bit, but would you rather have the optimism of a five-year-old girl who wants to be a horse, or the pessimism of an adult who says in despair, \"I can't be anything at all\"? Teddy Roosevelt said, _ believe that is the way to make those dreams come true. It begins with looking up and dreaming of something beautiful.", "Cuba's former leader, Fidel Castro,died at the age of 90,according to a November 25 announcement on Cuban state television. The death marks the passing of a controversial figure who made a major impact on international affairs during his long rule. The Cuban government declared nine days of official mourning. On Monday, thousands of Cubans lined up near Havana's Plaza of the Revolution to pay their final respects to their leader. On Wednesday,Castro's ashes will begin a three-day journey across Cuba to Santa Ifigenia cemetery in Santiago de Cuba. Castro was born into a middle-class family on August 13 1926. He spent his childhood alongside the laborers on his father's plantation . In 1945, Castro entered the University of Havana as a law student. He later joined groups that sought to end dictatorships in Latin-American countries. On July 26. 1953,Castro staged an unsuccessful revolt against Batista's government. He and his brother Raul were captured and imprisoned for two years. After they were freed, the brothers went into exile in Mexico, On November 25, 1956,Castro set out once again to overthrow Batista. His revolution grew in strength. On New Year s Day 1959, Batista fled from Cuba. Castro took absolute power on January 8. The U.S. viewed Castro's relationship with the Soviet Union as a threat. In 1961,President John F. Kennedy approved the invasion of Cuba by 1,500 Cuban exiles. They landed on April 17 at the Bay of Pigs, but with little U. S. military support. Cuban troops smashed the attack within a few days. In October 1962,Castro confronted Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis, during which he allowed the Soviet Union to place nuclear-capable missiles in Cuba. By that time, the U. S. had cut all relations with Cuba. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991,Cuba lost its economic support. To fuel the economy, the Cuban government allowed outside investment in hotels and resorts, but that created inequality. Meanwhile, Castro continued to crack down on any opposition. After undergoing intestinal surgery in 2006,Castro handed Cuba's presidency to Raul. The transition of power became official in 2008.", "City Varieties The Headrow, Leeds.

Social networking has been in existence for at least 150 years, and probably longer than that. In the times before the invention of the computer and the World Wide Web (WWW), social networking was done in person. People who had similar likes and interests would gather together to share experiences, make new friends, and improve their businesses. On the Internet, social networking websites made their first appearances during the late 1990s. The first major social networking website in the United States was MySpace. MySpace allowed its users to exchange messages, share pictures, and make new friends in a way that was never thought of in the past. With MySpace, people who did not go out much could reach out to others from their own homes. In 2004, Facebook was created. It was first a website created for use by Harvard University's students and teachers, but it soon expanded to include just about everyone. It is now larger than some of the largest companies in the world. It is a website that is changing all the time. Facebook has completely changed the way people stay connected with each other and the rest of the world. The way it works is simple. Users can set up a new account easily. All a new user needs is an email address to start. Once a person has created an account and his friend also has his own Facebook page, he can invite his friend by sending a request out to him. Once you get started, making new friends will come easily.", "From cosy cabins and yurts to campervans and huts with character and mod-cons, winter camping can be cool, rather than just chilly, in these beautiful UK settings.

We call these balls Yuanxiao or Tangyuan. Obviously, they get the name from the festival itself. It is said that the custom of eating Yuanxiao originated during the Eastern Jin Dynasty in the fourth century, then became popular during the Tang and Song periods. The fillings inside the dumplings or Yuansiao are either sweet or salty. Sweet fillings are made of sugar, Walnuts, sesame , osmanthus flowers , rose petals, sweetened tangerine peel, bean paste, or jujube paste . A single ingredient or any combination can be used as the filling . The salty variety is filled with minced meat , vegetables or a mixture. The way to make Yuanxiao also varies between northern and southern China. The usual method followed in southern provinces is to shape the dough of rice flour into balls, make a hole, insert the filling, then close the hole and smooth out the dumpling by rolling it between your hands. In North China, sweet or nutmeat stuffing is the usual ingredient. The fillings are pressed into hardened cores, dipped lightly in water and rolled in a flat basket containing dry glutinous rice flour. A layer of the flour sticks to the filling, which is then again dipped in water and rolled a second time in the rice flour. And so it goes, like rolling a snowball, until the dumpling is the desired size. The custom of eating Yuanxiao dumplings remains. This tradition encourages both old and new stores to promote their Yuanxiao products. They all try their best to improve the taste and quality of the dumplings to attract more customers.", "Electronic book publishing has many of the same risks and opportunities as electronic music publishing. By delivering text direct to the user's computer screen, the e-book could cut down costs, and allow creators to deal directly with their audience, bypassing traditional publishers and readers. But it also raises the possibility of mass piracy . Phil Rance, founder and managing director of Online Originals, a London-based e-book publisher, sums it up. \"No one wants Napster to happen to books.\" Indeed, the most popular MP3 have put the frighteners on an industry that generally operates some way behind the \"bleeding edge\". The Mata Group, a leading US-based market researcher, says publishers are far too concerned about protecting their rights, \"We believe all the recent legal control over Napster is like putting a finger in a river that is already overflowing. Publishers need to deal with reality and come up with new ways to develop wide electronic distribution , asking the question: 'How can we use the certainty of wide distribution to our advantage?'\" At the moment, most publishers would like to limit the use of e-books to the person who bought them, or to the computer used to download them. If that can be done, e-books become just an extra income stream in a publishing industry that would continue to operate the way it does today, according to Terry Robinson, business manager for Adobe's e-paper group. \"If you've cracked digital rights aspect, you've cracked the market,\" he says. Robert Nichols, Books Director at BOL agrees, \"Rights management is absolutely important. Publishers just say that 'until copyright is secure, we're not going to talk'.\"", "English is a language spoken all around the world. There are more than 42 countries where the majority of the people speak English. Most native speakers of English are found in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Ireland and New Zealand. In total, for more than 375 million people, English is their mother tongue. An equal number of people learn English as a second language. These people will perhaps speak the language of their own country at home with their family, but the language of the government, schools, newspapers and TV is English. However, the number of people who learn English as a foreign language is more than 750 million. Everywhere in the world children go to school to learn English. In China, students learn English at school as a foreign language, except for those in hong Kong, where many people speak English as a first or a second language. In only fifty years, English has developed into the language most widely spoken and used in the world. English is the working language of most international organizations, international trade and tourism. English is also the language of global culture, such as popular music and the Internet. You can listen to English songs on the radio or use English to communicate with people around the world through the Internet. With so many people communicating in English every day, it will become more and more important to have a good knowledge of English.", "Our surroundings are being polluted faster than nature and man's present efforts cannot prevent it. Time is bringing us more people, and more people will bring us more industry, more cars, larger cities, and the growing use of man-made materials. What can explain and solve this problem? The fact is that pollution is caused by man--by his desire for a modern way of life. We make \"increasing industrialization\" our chief aim. So we are often ready to offer everything: clean air, pure water, good food, our health and the future of our children. There is a constant flow of people from the countryside into the cities, eager for the benefits of our modern society. But as our technological achievements have grown in the last twenty years, pollution has become a serious problem. Isn't it time we stopped to ask ourselves where we are going--and why?

The good news is that we're making rapid progress at 530 miles per hour. The bad news is that we're lost and don't know where we're going.\" The sad fact is that this becomes a true story when spoken of our modern society.", "Below are some classified ads from the Internet. _ V2 cigs is undeniably the leader in the electronic cigarette industry.

Whether it is simply a jingle ,musical note or any other use of sound,music can play a huge role in attracting a customer's attention or being noticed by your target audience. Music can work hand-in-hand with what you are advertising. Many times the advertising jingle, or saying, is what the audience remembers. Companies such as McDonald's and Subway have used this method many times with different jingles and little sayings that are easy to remember and fun to sing along with. Usually concepts that are part of a jingle would sound conceited and pompous when said in a normal conversation. When put to music however, and sung in a rhythm,it suddenly sounds attractive. For example, if someone said,\" No one does it better than me\" in a normal statement, this would sound very conceited. Add music and a tune to this statement and it becomes attractive and fun for others to sing along with. While understanding how important music is for your advertising needs, it is also important for you to know the best way to get special music. Having people from many different backgrounds all over the world write something specifically for you is one of the best ways to get songs written just for you. You simply choose which one you believe is best for the project. So instead of hiring a single songwriter to compose your music, you can run a contest for you advertising jingle and songwriters around the world write you a finished jingle in an attempt to win your contest.", "It seems that Great Wall is the place to rock.

It is the person who is cheerful, has a smiling face and behaves as if he or she is enjoying every moment of the event! Such people have an optimistic opinion on life. They are the ones with a positive attitude. On the other hand, let's see that fellow in the corner with a long face. He is most probably thinking about the time and money wasted in having fun. He is a pessimist, one with a negative attitude. A person with a positive attitude gets on well with the job at hand. He doesn't worry about what's gone before or what might happen in the future. If there is a problem, he quickly thinks of ways to solve it. If the problem cannot be solved singly, he seeks help from someone else. He doesn't feel that it's beneath his dignity to seek assistance. When Sonal lost her history notes days before an important examination, she sat down and cried.

But Howie Choset sees in their delicate movements a way to save lives. The 37-year-old Carnegie Mellon University professor has spent years developing snake-like robots he hopes will eventually slide through fallen buildings in search of victims trapped after natural disasters or other emergencies. Dan Kara is president of Robotics Trends, a Northboro, Mass.-based company that publishes an online industry magazine and runs robotics trade shows. He said there are other snake-like robots being developed, mainly at universities, but didn't know of one that could climb pipes. The Carnegie Mellon machines are designed to carry cameras and electronic sensors and can be controlled with a joystick . They move smoothly with the help of small electric motors, or servos, commonly used by hobbyists in model airplanes. Built from lightweight materials, the robots are about the size of a human arm or smaller. They can sense which way is up, but are only as good as their human operators, Choset added. Sam Stover, a search term manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency based in Indiana, said snake-type robots would offer greater mobility than equipment currently available, such as cameras attached to extendable roles. \"It just allows us to do something we've not been able to do before,\" Stover said, \"We needed them yesterday.\" He said snifter dogs are still the best search tool for rescue workers, but that they can only be used effectively when workers have access to damaged building. Stover, among the rescue workers who handled the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, said snake robots would have helped rescuers search flooded houses in that disaster. Choset said the robots may not be ready for use for another five to ten years, depending on funding.", "Inventors are always looking for ways to make our lives easier, greener and a whole lot more fun.

But that Francisco Lopez and Ruby Nostrant track what climate change is doing to five different plants in Tucson, Arizona and they are only in the second grade. \"We are collecting data because the weather is changing and the plants are blooming,\" Ruby explained. Scores of other students at Borton Primary Magnet School and Sunnyside High School in Tucson are heading outdoors to be part of a new scientific push to figure out how the biological timing of the earth is changing. It's a research project that the average person, even a kindergartner, can join in. The National Phenology Network is calling on volunteers to help track early spring blooms and eventually changes in animals caused by global warming. It's called Project Budburst. When it was first open to the public last year, thousands of people participated in 26 states. \"All people can contribute to it by tracking the timing of flowering events or leaf-out events for plants and animals in their backyard,\" said Phenology Network director Jake Weltzin. He calls the volunteers \"citizen-scientists.\" The idea is that tracking flowers blooming--especially lilacs ; which everyday people have helped track for decades--is fairly simple. The Website http://www.Windows.ucar.edu/ citizen _ science/budburst/index.html gives directions on what to look for in different parts of the country. University of Maryland professor David Inouye said it's so easy to figure out what's blooming that a lack of special knowledge isn't a problem. University of Arizona ecology graduate student Lisa Benton coordinated the Tucson high school students as they looked at plants five minutes from their high school. Each student has specific guidelines and she's been happy so far with the data she is getting.

Her poetry often shows things that concerned her throughout her life, such as her search for a sense of home. Her troubled childhood and feelings of loneliness from this time affected her character and poetry. Bishop's painful childhood is apparent in some of her poems. Her father died when she was eight months old and her mother was mad when she was five. Bishop was raised firstly by her mother's parents and then by her father's parents. This experience left her confused about belonging. She had no home and this was shown in her poetry. In \"A Prodigal\", when the character in the poem makes up his mind to go home, there is a sense of pessimism for Bishop who has no home. The lack of a sense of home has contributed to her depression all her life. Bishop attempts to make small, everyday experiences extraordinary in her poems such as \"Filling Station\" .In \"Filling Station \", Bishop describes the beautyof a family filling station. Although it is \"dirty\" there is order in it. Simple family life is celebrated in it. She recognizes the value of home and beauty in everyday life, but she is only an observer of these. Distance remains between her and the family at the filling station. Bishop's struggle to locate herself in the world is seen no more clearly than in \"sandpiper\". It deals with searching for something in a confusing world. She uses the metaphor of the bird which is \"looking for something\". The \"something\" isn't specific . It seems as if the bird doesn't know what he wants; the only certain thing is that he is searching. Bishop's poems are personal on a more subtle level, especially when her childhood, travels, etc, are taken into consideration. It is believed that Bishop is a complex poet who uses her poetry to find this feeling of belonging.", "The French Revolution broke out in 1789. At the time France was in a crisis. The government was badly run and people's lives were miserable. King Louis XIV tried to control the national parliament and raise more taxes. But his effort failed. He ordered his troops to Versailles. The people thought that Louis intended to put down the Revolution by force. On July 14, 1789, they stormed and took the Bastille, where political prisoners were kept. Ever since that day, July 14 has been the French National Day. Louis tried to flee the country in 1792, to get support from Austria and Prussia. However, he was caught and put in prison. In September 1792, the monarchy was abolished _ . In the same year, Louis was executed. A few months later his wife, Marie also had her head cut off. The Revolution of France had frightened the other kings of Europe. Armies from Austria and Prussia began to march against France. The French raised republican armies to defend the nation. The Revolution went through a period of terror.

With the high price of petrol, the UK is the second most expensive country in Europe. However, diesel is more expensive in the UK than anywhere else in Europe. The report by the websiteuSwitch analyses 10 European countries against 17 different benchmarks , from the price of gas, electricity, fuel, food and drink to the money each country spends on education, health to working conditions and the weather. The top three countries are France, Spain and Denmark, with Sweden, Ireland and Britain coming eighth, ninth and tenth respectively. The study comes less than a week after the United Nations moved Britain out of the top 20 list of most _ countries to live in for the first time. Although France and Germany were at the beginning hit hard by the global financial crisis, both have officially got out of the trouble, while Britain has yet to prove this has happened. Later this week, despite signs of recovery in the housing market and rising sales, unemployment is still expected to have climbed to above 2.5 million for the first time since 1994.", "I was born and raised in Minnesota, the USA,but as an adult I have mostly lived in Europe and Africa. I teach cross-cultural management at the International Business School near Paris. For the last 15 years, I've studied how people in different parts of the world build trust,communicate, and make decisions especially in the workplace. While traveling in Tokyo recently with Japanese colleague,I gave a short talk to a group of 20 managers. At the end, I asked whether there were any questions or comments.No hands went up,so I went to sit down.My colleague whispered to me,\"I think there actually were some comments, Erin.Do you mind if I try?\" I agreed, but I guessed it a waste of breath. He asked the group again, \"Any comments or questions?\" Still, no one raised a hand, but this time he looked very carefully at each person in the silent audience. Gesturing to one of them, he said, \"Do you have something to add?\" To my amazement,she responded \"Yes, thank you.\" and asked me a very interesting question. My colleague repeated this several times,looking directly at the audience and asking for more questions or comments. After the session, I asked my colleague, \"how do you know that those people had questions?\" He hesitated, not sure how to explain it, and then said, \"It has to do with how bright their eyes are.\" He continued, \"In Japan, we don't make as much direct eye contact as you do in the West. So when you asked if there were any comments, most people were not looking directly at you. But a few people in the group were looking right at you, and their eyes were bright. That indicates that they would be happy to have you call on them.\" I thought to myself I would never have learned from my upbringing in Minnesota. Since then, I try to focus on understanding behavior in other cultures I encounter, and keep finding the bright eyes in the room.", "Lake Forest High School Clubs Environmental Club Club members are provided opportunities to realize their goals of environmental service.

Recently the attack on illiteracy had been stepped up. A world plan has been drawn up by a committee of UNESCO experts in Paris, as part of the United Nations Development Decade ,and an international conference of the subject has also been held. UNESCO stresses that functional literacy is the aim. People must learn the basic skills of responsible citizenship, the ability of reading notices, newspapers, timetables, letters, price-lists to keep simple records and accounts, to select the importance of the information gathered, and to fill in the forms. The major areas of illiteracy are in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. In Africa there are at least one hundred million illiterate people, which is eighty to eighty-five percent of the total population. In Europe the figure is about twenty-four million; most of them are in Sothern Europe, with Spain, Italy, Portugal, Yugoslavia heading the list (the United Kingdom has about seven hundred thousand). UNESGO is eager for each country in the world, poor or rich, to wipe out illiteracy.", "Many people are concerned about the state of the earth in terms of its energy supplies and changing climate.The clear message broadcast by all responsible governments is that every person has a part to play.Here are some detailed instructions. 1.Prevent pollution by disposing of all your litter and waste in the correct,legal way,such as using onstreet waste receptacles when you are out and about,or putting it in your domestic rubbish can when you're at home.Follow local procedures for normal waste disposal.Contact your local authority for advice on disposing of unusual waste items,such as paint and computer parts. 2.Recycle all materials that can be processed by your local authority.Place plastics,metals,paper and glass in the correct collection receptacles.Donate unwanted items to the charities that are happy to accept good condition clothing,furniture and even automobiles. 3.Look after reserves of water by making sure you turn off the tap after use and by repairing leaks and drips.Purchase waterefficient appliances.Take showers instead of baths.Gather rainwater for garden use and use your lawn sprinkler less often or not at all. 4.Save energy by choosing Energy Star products.Turn these off,as well as lights,when you don't need them to be on.Use air condition and heating less often.Make sure your home is insulated correctly to maintain a steady temperature. 5.Reduce the amount of the material you use.Print emails occasionally or not at all rather than printing them every time.You buy new things when you actually need them rather than on a whim .Organize a car pool with friends to use fuel efficiently.

Our class organized an activity to raise money for the library, and in one month, Jennifer read 34 books. I couldn't believe it. Surely, she was from some faraway planet where creature lived and they didn't own television sets. How could a human being, a 13-year-old girl, read 34 books in one month? I had read three books. And by \"read\", I mean skimmed. I mean opened and placed them on my lap while watching cartoons. Who had time to read? In addition to my favorite cartoons, I had a basketball that required playing, a baseball that required throwing, and a volleyball that required volleying. And it wasn't as if my bike could ride itself. Besides, reading was boring. And if I wanted to be bored, it would be much easier just to pay attention during Mr. Kearly's social studies class. After senior high school, my education had become very narrow: computer engineering, mathematics, physics, and not much else. Years later, I realized something: I had not memory of ever reading a book for pleasure. But there was a world of knowledge outside science and engineering, and I was tired of being ignorant of it, so I decided I would become a reader. I dived into book after book. In short, the bookworm within me had awakened. Today, I carry a book(if not two or three) with me wherever I go. An hour-long waiting for the bus is not trouble; rather, it's a chance to enjoy a few chapters of Malcolm Gladwell's latest works. Sometimes, I wish my waiting was longer.", "There is always a man who stands on different comers of the street in our city, holding a sign that reads \"Will work for food for my family\". Normally I don't have much money to help him. When my mother is with me and she sometimes makes me pull over and then she will hand him some money. Tonight, I was on my way to the store to get some milk when I saw the man. My daughter and her friend were in the car. We all felt awful that this man was standing out in the cold, wet weather. Many people had made comments that he should be able to work. I often wondered why he would stand out there rather than be in the warmth of a building, working. Well, he might not have an address, and he may need an address in order to apply for a job. Either way, I don't feel it is _ to judge. As I was sharing that feeling with my daughter and her friend, I decided that I needed to help this man. I wanted to show the girls the importance of helping others, not about worrying whether he was legitimately struggling or not. So, when we pulled over to give him some money, I said, \"God bless you,\" and he said it back to us. But the girls and I were still concerned that he would be cold, standing out in the bad weather. So we got him a hot chocolate and a hamburger. My daughter handed them to him and l told the man that the girl wanted to help him because she was worried about him being cold. He was very sweet and appreciative. We all left with smiles, especially me, because, as we were pulling away, the girls were talking about ways they could raise money to help the man and others like him. It was the best trip I have ever made to get milk!!!", "Earth Day has come and gone, but it's a fact of daily life that 1.6 billion people around would have no electricity in their homes. Instead, most of them use wood, coal or even animal waste to heat and cook in their homes ,which also gives off greenhouse gases, causing indoor air pollution that kills 1.6million people a year, most of whom are children and women. It's not expected to improve much, and in Africa it's becoming worse now. By 2030, when the Earth's population will be likely to top 8billion, 1.3 billion people will still lack electricity. Of those, 700 million will be in Africa, and 490 million in South Asia. Ghana, in West Africa, most of the northern half of the country lives without lights. As a result, three out of four Ghanans in the north are without electricity to refrigerate with and to cook with, to study with and to start businesses with. Like most others around the world in the same situation, these Ghanans use traditional fuels( wood, coal, animal waste) to meet their cooking needs. What would electricity for everyone around the world cost?

' Energy services are very important formeeting basic human needs, reducing poverty, creating and getting together wealth and keeping advances in social development,\" He said in an announcement.", "Most people who move to a foreign country may experience a period of time when they have a lot of stress in the new culture. This feeling is often called \"culture shock\" and it is important to learn how to deal with culture shock. First of all, you should know that everyone in a new situation will go through some form of culture shock. There are four general stages of cultural adjustment . The first stage is usually referred to as the honeymoon stage. Upon arriving in a new environment, you'll be interested in the new culture. Everything will seem exciting, and everyone will seem friendly and helpful. The second stage is called the withdrawal stage. The excitement that you felt before changes to frustration as you find it difficult to deal with new problems. The language is hard to learn; friends are hard to make; simple things like shopping and going to the bank are challenges. It is at this stage that you are likely to feel anxious and homesick. If you are one of those who manage to stick it out , you will enter the third stage---- the recovery stage. At this point, you'll feel more confident in the new culture. You'll start to understand and accept the way things are done and the way people behave in your new environment. The last stage is the stability stage---- this is the point when people start to feel at home in the new culture. At this stage, you will behave well in the new culture, and prefer some aspects of the new culture to your own culture. There is, in a sense, a fifth stage to this process. If you decide to return home after a long period in a new culture, you may experience what is called \"reverse culture shock\". This means that you may find aspects of your own culture \"foreign\", because you're so used to the new culture. Reverse culture shock is usually pretty mild and doesn't last for very long.", "Fun, and maybe more Nickname: tatoosun Email: tatoosun2003@yahoo.com When to travel: Jun 2007 - Aug 2007 Who am I: Slender African girl in her late 20's.

After a long trip by bus, we got on the ship. After a while, we stopped and everyone on the ship started to shout because we saw a humpback whale . It was wonderful. Sometimes, whales came so close to the ship that you thought you could easily touch them. While we were watching the whales, a guide was giving us some information about them. She told us that we saw only two kinds of whales -- 50-foot humpback whales (singing whales) and 70-foot fin back whales (the second largest whales on earth). She also said we could easily recognize a whale by its tail because every whale has a different kind of tail just like people have different fingerprints. They all have names, and on this trip, we saw \"Salt\" and \"Pepper\", two whales named by a biologist and a fisherman. They were swimming together all the time. I took twenty-seven photos, but it was very hard to take them because the whales were quick and stayed on the surface of the ocean just for a short time. It was really something. It was one of the chances that a person hardly ever experiences in life, but I had that chance.", "Stepping into a pool of water is common enough ,but who could ever imagine ; stopping into a pool of fish? In February of 1974, Bill Tapp ,an Australian farmer,saw a rain of fish that covered his farm .How surprised he must have been when he heard many fish hitting against his roof! What caused this strange occurrence ?This is a question that had long puzzled people who study fish .The answer turned out to be a combination of wind and storm. When it is spring in the northern part of the world ,it is fall in Australia, Throughout the autumn season ,terrible storms arise and rains flood the land .The strong winds sweep over Australia like huge vacuum cleaners, collecting seaweed ,pieces of wood ,and even schools of fish .Strong winds may carry these bits of nature for many miles before vacuum dropping them on fields, houses ,and stonishedpeople. Although they seem unusual ,fish-falls occur quite frequently in Australia.When Bill Tapp was asked to describe the scene of fish ,he remarked, \"They look like millions of dead birds falling down.\" His statement is not surprising .The wonders of the natural world are as common as rain .Nature ,with its infinite wonders ,can create waterfalls that flow upward and fish that fall out of the sky.", "A family in Guelph, Ontario is spending a year living \"in 1982\".They're doing it so their kids can see what life was like before technology like iPads, computers and even coffee machines was part of everyday life.

The biggest majority of Brazil's population belongs to the Christian religion and almost all of them are Catholics. This is something Brazil inherited being Portugal's colony . Historically, the country was a colony claimed by people from Portugal and this made Portuguese the official language. The Portuguese reached Brazil in 1500 and until that moment it was inhabited by semi-nomadic people. The Portuguese changed Brazil into a country of slaves until 1800, when Maria I of Portugal came to live in Brazil. The Queen did not stay long in Brazil, but during the 20 years of royal presence a lot of changes occurred: commercial ports to United Kingdom were opened; Brazil stopped being isolated from other countries. So at the moment of getting the independence on the 7th of September, 1822, Brazil already had the potential to develop. The Brazilian Empire, Pedro I, abolished slavery in 1888 in the face of Princess Isabel. A lot of European people started coming to Brazil and the industry of the country started working. In the 19th and the 20th century as it has been said above foreign people immigrated to Brazil and basically 5 million European and Japanese people became the residents of Brazil. The beginning of the 20th century was especially marked by the immigration of a lot of Asian people: Japanese, Korean and Chinese immigrants. As a matter of fact Japanese people do not immigrate a lot, and the fact that the Brazilian-Japanese people are the largest Japanese minority in the world does astonish greatly. The majority of the cultural inherits of Brazil are actually Portuguese, due to the fact that Brazil was Portugal's colony for a very long time. The southern states mainly consist of European population and the north and the northeast consist of a mixed population including Africans, Amerindians and Europeans. Most of this population is Roman Catholic. No other country in the world has the same amount of Catholics. The modern tendency of Brazil is the growing number of people calling themselves Protestants. Around 7.4% of the population don't believe any god. Some Brazilians, especially in the northern states are mixed Africans who prefer following the traditional African religions. Only 1.8% of the population chose Buddhism, Islam or Judaism. Though Brazil always tried to maintain democracy, it was failed several times by the dictatorship of Getulo Vargas. This fact could not affect the political situation in the country.", "Matt and his wife lived in the country. Matt was very mean and hated spending money. One day a fair came to the nearby town. They went to the fair and looked at all the things to buy. Matt's wife wanted to buy a hat only costing $28, but was refused. Later on, a comb of $5 attracted her attention, but he would not let her spend any money. Then, in a nearby field, they saw a small airplane. \"Fun flight!\" the notice said, \"$10 for 10 minutes.\" Matt had never been in an airplane and he wanted to go on a fun flight. However, he didn't want to pay for his wife either. \"I've only got $10,\" he told the pilot. \"Can my wife come with me for free?\" The pilot wasn't selling many tickets, so he said, \"I'll make a bargain with you. If your wife doesn't scream, she can have a free flight.\" Matt agreed, and got into the small airplane with his wife. The pilot took off and made his airplane do all kinds of things. At one moment it was flying upside down. When the plane landed, the pilot said, \"OK, your wife didn't make a sound. She can have her ride free.\" \"Thank you,\" Matt said, \"it wasn't easy for her, you know, especially when she fell out.\"", "The World's Largest Insect .This giant insect can be used as a toy. A child ties one end of a string to a stick and the other end around the \"neck\" of an insect. Holding the stick, the child lets the insect go. With a loud whirring sound, the insect takes off, pulling the string in a large curve over the child's head. The child laughs as the stick jumps around. The child is African, and the toy is the African Goliath beetle, the largest insect in the world. The Goliath is a true insect because it has six legs and a body that is divided into three parts. Like all beetles, it has two pairs of wings. The front pair are thick and stiff and protect the back pair, which are soft. It is these soft back wings that make the beetle fly forward. They also cause the loud whirring sound the beetle makes when it flies. To steer, the beetle twists and turns its legs the same way you steer a bike by turning its front wheel. African children often use the Goliath beetle as a toy. Although it is over 15 centimeters long, it is quite harmless.", "Australia has promised to introduce the most comprehensive carbon trading program outside Europe in 2010. The government in Canberra plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least five percent by 2020, but it could make bigger reductions if other countries agree to tougher targets. The Australian government warns that without tough environmental measures the country could lose key industries and jobs. Climate Change Minister Penny Wong says the economy is under threat and decisive action is needed. Central to the government's climate change plan is a carbon emissions trading program that will be introduced within two years. It would involve one thousand of the nation's biggest companies and would cover about three-quarters of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. Many scientists believe that greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, contribute to global warming. Many of them are released by burning fuels such as coal and oil. Companies will be required to buy permits for each ton of carbon they emit, although big polluting exporters will receive up to 90 percent of their carbon licenses free. Many business leaders want the government to delay the plan because of the current global financial crisis, which is slowing the Australian economy. Peter Anderson from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says it is irresponsible to bring in a carbon trading plan now. Environmentalists, on the other hand, say Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has not properly addressed the threat of climate change. Activists had sought a minimum emissions cut of 25 percent. Instead, the Rudd government aims to cuts carbon emissions by at least five percent of 2000 levels by 2020. That amount could rise to 15 percent, if future global agreements set such a target. Ray Nias of the environmental group WWF says Australia will pay the price for low targets. \"This is a deeply, deeply disappointing target,\" Nias said. \"It commits Australia to long-term climate change. It will make Australia's ability to negotiate global agreements very, very difficult. It is much lower than even we had imagined.\" Australia has one of the highest per-person greenhouse emissions rates in the world because of its reliance on coal for electricity. _", "Australia has promised to introduce the most comprehensive carbon trading program outside Europe in 2010.

The museum decided to open the watch after being contacted by the watchmaker's great-great-grandson, Doug Stiles, who had received a letter from a in Ireland. It said that the family had found a letter Dillon had written about the purported message in the watch. Then Stiles, a 57 -year-old real estate lawyer in Waukegan,Illinois, searched on the Internet and found a New York Times article from 1906, where Dillon told the story at the age of 84. During the interview, Dillon said that he unscrewed the dial of the watch and wrote on the metal as soon as he heard the news about the first shot of the Civil War. \"The first gun is fired. Slavery is dead. Thank God we have a President who at least will try.\" However, the actual message that the museum found is different from what Dillon recalled. It reads, \"Jonathan Dillon, April 13-1861, Fort Sumpter [sic] was attacked by the rebels on the above date J Dillon, April 13 -1861, Washington, thank God we have a government, Jonth Dillon.\"", "Why is pink or purple a color for girls and blue or brown for boys? The answer depends largely on cultural values as well as personal experiences. To the Egyptians, green was a color that represented the hope and joy of spring, while for Muslims, it means heaven. Red is a symbol of good luck in many cultures. In China, children are given money in a red envelope to bring good fortune in the New Year. For many nations, blue is a symbol of protection and religious beliefs. Greek people often wear a blue necklace hoping to protect themselves against evils . People's choice of colors is also influenced by their bodies' reactions toward them. Green is said to be the most restful color. It has the ability to reduce pain and relax people both mentally and physically. People who work in green environment have been found to have fewer stomach aches. Red can cause a person's blood pressure to rise and increase people's appetites . Many decorators will include different shades of red in the restaurant. Similarly, many commercial websites will have a red \"Buy Now\" button because red is a color that easily catches a person's eye. Blue is another calming color. Unlike red, blue can cause people to lose appetite. So if you want to eat less, some suggest that eating from blue plates can help. The next time you are deciding on what to wear or what color to decorate your room, think about the color carefully.", "Most recently, it's very common in students who need a parent present for job interviews. Naturally, it's easy to blame the students in these situations, but the bigger problem is us. We--as parents--are so eager to protect our kids that we fail to realize that this in itself is harming them. As the mother of two young sons, I have to remind myself all the time that the biggest responsibility I have as a parent is to help them develop the skills needed to live in, to live without me. So, I'll let them fail. I'll let them fail because as long as they are safe and warm inside their comfort zones, they will never grow. And failure--along with loss, heartbreak, disappointment, etc.--will be part of growth for them. Call me the anti-tiger mom, but leaving them alone is my way of helping them become equipped to fit in this world as we know it today. From terrorism and seemingly endless natural disasters, to our national debt and beyond, if we expect the next generation to stand up to the very real problems of our time, we need to stop feeding them and start teaching them how to fish. My children are faced with hard situations in their own life almost each day, but they try to negotiate everything now. It's a small price to help them learn a skill they'll use for the rest of their lives, including when I don't come with them on job interviews.", "Close your eyes and imagine you are living in the next two centuries or more. You'll be living in a world filled with smart robots, which will be helping you to take care of your children, or your elderly parents in your home. You'll live much longer thanks to the medicine made by genetic science. And mankind may be going farther in space than ever before---you will be living on the moon or Mars. How should we view the changes that wait for us in the future? Should we be optimistic about the years ahead, or worried about what the future holds? Some scientists and experts are having a discussion about how technology, science and society will develop in the future. \"I'm looking forward to the day when more technology will come to my life.\" Says Hohn Searle, a professor at the University of California Berkeley Philosophy, \"because I think further research in such areas as genetics, physics, chemitry and medicine will help us to overcome poverty , improve health, and make life longer.\" Hugh Herr, at MIT's Biomechatronecs Group, considers very powerful weapons as concern over the future. Another is the growing role of technology in our lives. \"Machines taking over what humans do is not a good thing,\" Herr says. That is a similar concern shared by Danisla Cerqui, a social and cultural scientist. \"I am afraid that the long-term future we are building will have no space left for human beings,\"says Cerqui. \" The main values of our society are related to information that must progress as quickly as possible, and computers are much better than humans in these tasks.\" (293words)", "Charlie was spending his summer holidays by the sea. One day he climbed over some rocks. He was looking for some crabs for supper. He took off his shorts and put them on a rock. The afternoon went quickly. Time was flying by. Look!

Archaeological finds trace the tradition back to the 6thcentury; it is supposed that the beginnings of paper cutting were even a few centuries earlier. Paper cuttings are used for religious purposes, for decoration and as patterns . Today, paper cuttings are mainly used as decoration. They _ walls, windows, doors, columns mirrors, lamps and lanterns in homes. They are also used for decoration on presents, and are given as presents themselves. They are of special importance at festivals. At the Spring Festival for example, entrances are decorated with paper cuttings which are supposed to bring good luck. Paper cuttings are not produced by machine, but by hand. There are two kinds of paper cuttings; scissor cuttings and knife cuttings. Scissor cuttings are fashioned with scissors. Several pieces of paper--- up to eight pieces---are fastened together. The motif is then cut with sharp, pointed scissors. Knife cuttings are fashioned by putting several layers of paper on a relatively soft foundation consisting of a mixture of tallow and ashes. Following a pattern, the artist cuts the motif into the paper with a sharp knife which he usually holds vertically . The advantage of knife cuttings is that considerably more paper cuttings can be made in one operation than scissor cuttings. In the countryside, paper cuttings are usually made only by women and girls. This used to be one of the skills that every girl was to master and that were often used to judge brides . Professional paper cutting artists are, on the other hand, almost always men who have guaranteed incomes and work together in workshops.", "Applying to Stellinga College Why Stellinga?

By comparison, in America only 3 people in 100,000 reach 100. But these Russian old people aren't alone. The Pakistanis, who live high in the Himalaya Mountains, and the Ecuadorans of the Andes Mountains seem to share the secret of long life, too. These people remain healthy in body and spirit despite the passage of time. While many older persons in industrial societies become weak and ill in their 60s and 70s, some Caucasians aged 100 to 140, work in the fields beside their great-great-grandchildren. Even the idea of aging is foreign to them. When asked \"at what age does youth end?\"most of these old people had no answer. Several replied, \"Well, perhaps at age 80.\" What accounts for this ability to survive to such old age, and to survive so well?First of all, hard physical work is a way of life for all of these long-lived people. They begin their long days of physical labor as children and never seem to stop. For example, Mr . Rustam Mamedov is 142 years of age. His wife is 116 years old. They have been married for 90 years. Mr. Mamedov has no intention of retiring from his life as a farmer. \"Why?What else would I do?\"he asks. All these people get healthful rewards from the environment in which they work. They all come from mountainous regions. They live and work at elevations of 1,660 to 1,000 meters above sea level. The air has less oxygen and is pollution-free. This reduced-oxygen environment makes the heart and blood vessel system stronger. Another factor that may contribute to the good health of these people is their isolation. To a great extent, they are separated from the pressures and worries of industrial society. Inherited factors also play some role. Most of the longest-lived people had parents and grandparents who also reached very old ages. Good family genes may, therefore, be one factor in living longer.", "Winslow Homer was the second of three sons of Henrietta Benson and Charles Savage Homer. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1836 and grew up in Cambridge. His father was an importer of tools and other goods. His mother was a painter. Window got his interest in drawing and painting from his mother. But his father also supported his son's interest. Once, on a business trip to London, Charles Homer bought a set of drawing examples for his son to copy. Young Winslow used these to develop his early skill. Winslow's older brother Charles went to Harvard University in Cambridge. The family expected Winslow would go, too. But, at the time, Harvard did not teach art. So Winslow's father found him a job as an assistant in the trade of making and preparing pictures for printed media. At 19, Window learned the process of lithography .This work was the only formal training that Winslow ever received in art. In 1859, Window Homer moved to New York City to work for Harper's Weekly. Homer also started to paint seriously. He hoped to go to Europe to study painting. But, something would intervene the direction of Window Homer's artistic work. Harper's magazine would send him to draw pictures of the biggest event in American history since independence. It was the Civil War between the Union and the rebel southern states. Winslow Homer went to Washington, D. C., in 1861. He drew pictures of the campaign of Union Army General George McClellan the next year. His pictures of the war showed many ways that conflicts affect people.", "China will soon put its first domestically developed electric aircraft into mass production, and designers expect a huge market at home and abroad. \"The RX1E is scheduled to receive its airworthiness(,,)certificate from the Civil Aviation Administration of China before the end of this year, with production expected to start next year,\" Yang Fengtian, an academic at the Chinese Academy of Engineering told China Daily on Thursday. \"This will be the first electric aircraft to be certified by our civil aviation authority. The success of the plane means China has become a technology leader in this filed,\" he added. An electric aircraft runs on electric motors, with electricity coming from fuel cells, solar cells, ultracapacitors, power beaming or batteries. Most of today's electric aircraft are experimental demonstration models. The first manned, electrically powered flight was made in 1973. \"We plan to reach an annual production of 100 such aircraft within three years, and the construction of a manufacturing plant that can make 100 RX1Es each year has begun in Shenyang,\" Yang said, adding that the plane, together with a set of batteries, will sell for nearly 1 million yuan ($163,000). The convenience of use, easy maintenance, low operating costs, high safety levels and eco-friendliness will bring the RX1E many buyers to serve a wide range of purposes, such as police patrols, flight training, entertainment and mapping surveys, he added. Yang said he expects that the Chinese market will need at least 1,000 RX1Es to meet the demand from general aviation businesses. With a maximum takeoff weight of 480 kg and a cruise speed of up to 160 kilometers per hour, the RX1E can fly 90 minutes based on a full charging of its batteries. It is able to carry loads for 230 km and fly at an altitude of nearly 3,000 meters. Yang said, \"In addition to the domestic market, _ .\"", "Swimming in the water of Hawaii's Big Island is a fun experience. But it can be more exciting if there are dolphins swimming around and jumping out of the sea too. For many people, it would be a wonderful dream to swim with these lovely animals! However, this may not be good for dolphins. They may get hurt because of human interaction . Dolphins are active and usually look for food at night. In the day, they like to rest in shallow bays . Many people think the dolphins are awake during the day as they swim. But when they sleep they rest half of their brain and keep the other half awake to breathe, so they may be sleeping even when they're swimming in the water. From 2010 to 2013, spinner dolphins of Hawaii's Big Island were exposed to human activities more than 82 percent of the time, according to Julian Tyne, a researcher at Australia's Murdoch University. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says disturbing the animals in their near-shore habitat could force them to swim to less favorable places, putting them at risk of attack by sharks and other animals. Besides, when people are around, dolphins become more active. Thus, they can't get enough sleep. \"Disturbing their resting behaviors can actually affect their long term health and the health of the dolphin population,\" Ann Garrett of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service told the Associated Press. As a result, the NOAA wants to make rules to help protect the dolphins. For example, the agency may ban swimming with the Hawaii spinner dolphins. Or they may stop people from swimming in shallow bays when the dolphins are resting. Tour operators must also be taught to watch for signs to know when the dolphins are in their resting state.", "Fish species are expected to shrink in size by up to 24% because of global warming, say scientists. The scientists argue that failure to control greenhouse gas emissions will have a greater effect on marine ecosystems than previously thought. Previous research has suggested that changing ocean temperatures would affect both the distribution and the reproductive abilities of many species of fish. This new work suggests that fish size would also be heavily affected. The researchers built a model to see how fish would react to lower levels of oxygen in the water. As ocean temperatures increase, so do the body temperatures of fish. But, according to lead author, Dr William Cheung, from the University of British Columbia, the lower level of oxygen in the water is key. Warmer waters could decrease ocean oxygen levels and greatly reduce fish body weight. On the other hand, rising temperatures directly increase the metabolic rate of the fish's body function. This leads to an increase in oxygen demand for normal body activities. So the fish will run out of oxygen for growth at a smaller body size. The research team also used its model to predict fish movements as a result of warming waters. The group believes that most fish populations will move towards the Earth's poles at a rate of up to 35km per decade. \"So in, say, the North Sea,\" says Dr Cheung,\" one would expect to see more smaller-body fish from tropical waters in the future.\" Taking these factors into consideration, the research team concludes that fish body size will shrink between 14% and 24%, with the largest decreases in the Indian and Atlantic oceans. When compared with actual observations of fish sizes, the model seems to _ what's actually happening in the seas. The researchers looked at two case studies involving North Atlantic cod and haddock. They found that recorded data on these fish showed greater decreases in body size than the models had predicted. Dr Alan Baudron, from the University of Aberdeen, UK, believes smaller-sized fish could seriously affect the ability of fish to reproduce. \"Smaller fish produce fewer and smaller eggs which could affect the reproductive potential of fish stocks,\" he said.", "\"In my country, men usually go to restaurants on their own. They always take their shoes off before they go in. Then they usually sit on the floor around a small, low table. In the evening they often sing songs.\" \"You usually take chocolates or flowers. But you always take an odd number of flowers, and you remove the paper before you give them to the hostess. You can also send flowers before you arrive. you don't usually take wine except when you visit very close friends.\" \"We always offer our guests something to drink when they arrive, tea, coffee or perhaps water or soft drinks. We think it is polite to accept a drink even if you're not thirsty. If you visit someone you always stay for a few drinks. When you have had enough to drink, you tap your cup or put your hand over it. If you say no, your host will insist that you have more to drink.\" \"People's private lives are very important so they never ask you personal questions about your family or where you live or your job. They never talk about religion or matters of finance, education or politics, but usually stay with safe subjects like the weather, films, plays, books and restaurants.\" \"It's difficult to know when to leave, but an evening meal usually lasts about three or four hours. When the host serves coffee, this is sometimes a sign that the evening is nearly over, but you can have as much coffee as you want.\" \"If the invitation says eight o'clock then we arrive exactly at eight. With friends we know well, we sometimes arrive about fifteen minutes before.\" \"Obviously it depends on the occasion, but most dinner parties are informal. The men don't usually wear a suit, but they may wear a jacket and tie. Women are usually smart but casual.\"", "Eyesight problems are common among all ages and if they are left untreated, they can cause serious headaches or other problems. The good news is that most eyesight problems can easily be sorted out by wearing glasses. Regular eye tests are important for everyone. Children and teenagers, under the age of 16 and up to the age of 19 for those full-time education, have the right to have eye tests for free in Britain. As the eye test is free, there's no excuse for not having a regular eye test. Doctors suggest that it's better to have an eye test about once a year. Wearing glasses isn't always regarded as all that cool and teens who suddenly need to wear glasses may find it difficult to accept. If they've grown up wearing glasses, then they may be more used to it. However, if your eyes are in poor health, not wearing glasses can put even more pressure on your eyes and could make them even worse. Thankfully, the days of little choice of glasses frames for teenagers are gone and there's now a wide selection of frames. If a teen does need to wear glasses, then it's good to let him or her choose the type, as he or she will be able to choose something he or she feels comfortable. Don't forget to be guided by the experts on glasses too.", "ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - One of the world's most famous fossils - the 3.2 million-year-old Lucy skeleton unearthed in Ethiopia in 1974 - will go on an exhibition tour abroad for the first time in the United States, officials said Tuesday. Even the Ethiopian public has only seen Lucy twice. The Lucy on exhibition at the Ethiopian National Museum in the capital, Addis Ababa, is _ while the real remains are usually locked in a secret storeroom. A team from the Museum of National Science in Houston, Texas, spent four years discussing with the Ethiopians for the U.S. tour, which will start in Houston next September. \"Ethiopia's rich culture of both the past and today, is one of the best kept secrets in the world,\" said Joel Bartsch, director of the Houston museum.

Being very short of money, I applied. Three days later, a letter arrived, asking me to go to Croydon for an interview. It proved a tiring journey: a train to Croydon station; a ten-minute bus ride and then a walk of at least fifteen minutes. It was clearly the headmaster himself that opened the door. He was short and fat, with a grey-color1ed moustache,a deeply lined face and hardly any hair. He looked at me with surprised disapproval. Then he said. \"You'd better come inside.\" Leading me into his study, he started to ask me a number of questions: what subjects I had taken in my General School Certificate;how old I was; what games I played; whether I thought games were an important part of a boy's education, etc. I said something about not attaching too much importance to them. We obviously had very little in common. The teaching arrangement filled me with fear. I was to divide the class of twenty-four boys, aged from seven to thirteen, into three groups and teach them all subjects--including art, football, cricket and so on--in turn at three different levels. Actually, I was depressed at the thought of teaching algebra and geometry--two subjects in which I had been rather weak at school. I said shyly, \"What would my salary be?\" \"Twelve pounds a week plus lunch.\" Before I could speak, he got to his feet. \"Now,\" he said, \"you'd better meet my wife.

This idea has inspired the award-winning photographer Andrew Zuckerman. He interviewed and took photos of fifty over-sixty-five-year-olds all over the world. His project explores various aspects of their lives. The photos and interviews are now available on our website. Click on the introductions to read the complete interviews. Let us now have a culture of peace. ----Federico Mayor Zaragoza, Spain Federico Mayor Zaragoza obtained a doctorate in pharmacy from the Complutense University of Madrid in 1958. After many years spent in politics, he became Director-General of UNESCO in 1987. In 1999, he created the Foundation for a culture of Peace, of which he is now the president. In addition to many scientific publications, he has published four collections of poems and several books of essays. Writing is a discovery. ----Nadine Gordimer, South Africa Due to a weak heart, Nadine Gordimer attended school and university briefly. She read widely and began writing at an early age.

In industry, computers mean automation , and automation means unemployment. Computers in the prefix = st1 /United Stateshave already begun to take the place of workers whose tasks are simple. The variety of jobs, done only by humans in the past, which the machine can perform more rapidly, accurately and economically, increases with each new generation of computers. If we follow this trend, we will be faced with mass unemployment for all but a handful of highly trained professionals who will be more powerful and overworked than they are now. What can we do about it? It is foolish to dream of making history backwards. We cannot pass laws forbidding the advancement of science and technology. The computing machines are here, and they will grow because engineers want to build them, and politicians want their help in the process of government. In short they will develop and become popular because they enable us to complete tasks that could never before have been done, no matter how many unskilled laborers we might have set to work. Computers will continue to increase our intelligence for just the same reason that engines continue to strengthen our muscles. The question we must ask is not whether we shall have computers or not have computers, but rather, since we are going to have them, how we make the most humane and intelligent use of them.", "Ashley and Chris work in the same department designing postcards. Chris had a college degree in art and deeply felt that the degree of his designs was excellent. His last postcard showed the depth of a desert's beauty and delights. \"It's just a picture of the desert,\" Ashley said. \"Not deep at all.\" \"Some people desire seeing beauty,\" Chris replied. \"Mine delivers that\". Ashley laughed and said, \"well, that depends on what you think beauty is.\" Days later, someone delivered a letter to Ashley. The letter said, \"You are worthy of the bad things that will come your way. You will know the taste of defeat, and I will destroy you.\" Ashley suddenly felt very cold. It was as if the room temperature had dropped 30 degrees. \"Who would do such a shocking deed?\" she wondered. \"I will not let a simple letter defeat me.\" Just then, Chris came into the room and offered Ashley a piece of his sandwich. \"Try some,\" he smiled widely. \"It's delicious.\" \"Are you trying to poison me?\" Ashley asked. Chris's answer was delayed from confusion. \"What's your problem?\" he asked. The next day, Ashley brought a bat to use to defend herself. When Chris saw her bat, he joked, \"Defend and win one for the team.\" Ashley took no notice of him. She spent the whole day reading self-defending books and placed her work on delay. \"You can't delay your work. Our job demands us to do our work on time,\" Chris said. \"We must meet the demands of our job.\" \"You're not the boss,\" Ashley replied. \"Don't make demands of me.\" Because Ashley failed to do her work, she was fired. Chris glanced at Ashley's empty desk and smiled.", "CNN news-Jan 16,2013 Protests have been going on for about a week now in the northern Irish capital of Belfast.
