Richings), waking up in a cube-shaped room with glowing, computer circuit-like walls and six doors, one at the center of each wall, ceiling and floor. After recovering from his confusion, he opens two of the doors and looks into them to find rooms that differ to the one he is in only by color. He then opens and goes through a third door. He looks around and then takes a step, but is suddenly cut into large cubes. He falls apart and the rack of crosshatched wires which diced him moves into view. It folds up and retracts.Later, in another room, several people find each other: Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint), Worth (David Hewlett), Holloway (Nicky Guadagni), Rennes (Wayne Robson), and Leaven (Nicole de Boer). None of them know where they are, how they got there, or why they are there. Quentin, however, knows that there are traps, as he had looked into a room and nearly got his head cut off. The five decide to stay together and look for the way out. Rennes takes the lead. He exemplifies how to test for traps by tossing a boot into the rooms while holding onto the laces, to trigger potential traps, figuring that the trapped room contains motion detectors. Holloway speculates on several possible creators of the Cube, being aliens or the government his main ptions. Rennes remarks that staying still will not solve anything, and says that they should move in a straight line until they get to the end. The others agree, and they begin moving through the rooms.While moving, they discover a series of different numbers on the hatchways between each of the rooms. At one point, Rennes throws the boot in and does not find anything, but detects that the room has dry air, and deduces that it most likely employs an electrochemical sensor, which detects hydrogen sulphide emitted from the skin. Quentin realizes that Rennes is an escape artist who has escaped more than seven major prisons. Soon after, Rennes jumps into a room tested with a boot, and is sprayed in the face with acid. The others pull him back, but he dies as the acid corrodes his face and the inside of his head. The group decides that the room must have contained an electrochemical sensor which Rennes missed, and realize that they must find a better way of testing the rooms.Quentin asks everyone about their occupations. He says he is a police officer, Holloway says she is a doctor, and Worth says he works \"in an office building, doing office building stuff.\" Leaven claims simply to \"hang out\" with her friends. Quentin believes that nothing is a coincidence, that each of them has a purpose in the cube. After Holloway talks about her rings and broaches, Quentin asks why Leaven has her glasses, while Holloway has had her jewellery taken away. Leaven reveals herself to excel at mathematics, and after looking at the numbers on a crawlspace, theorizes that when one of those numbers is prime, the room is booby-trapped.Leaven's purpose becomes attempting to \"crack the Cube's code\", and they progress through the cubes. When they find themselves in a room with trapped rooms all around and below, Quentin checks the door in the ceiling, through which falls a seventh person: Kazan (Andrew Miller). He appears to be mentally handicapped. At least two of the others see him as a burden, but Holloway decides to bring him along.The group starts speculating about their surroundings, which causes a conflict between Quentin and Holloway. Quentin dismisses Holloway's ideas as conspiracy theories, and Holloway thinks that Quentin is naive. Soon after this, Quentin enters a room without prime numbers and narrowly avoids death from a trap consisting of rotating razor wires. Leaven's theory that non-prime-numbered rooms are safe is shown to be incorrect. Quentin begins suspecting that Worth is a spy, and is increasingly irritated by Kazan's mental state.

At one point, Rennes throws the boot in and does not find anything, but detects that the room has dry air, and deduces that it most likely employs an electrochemical sensor, which detects hydrogen sulphide emitted from the skin. Quentin realizes that Rennes is an escape artist who has escaped more than seven major prisons. Soon after, Rennes jumps into a room tested with a boot, and is sprayed in the face with acid.

The group decides that the room must have contained an electrochemical sensor which Rennes missed, and realize that they must find a better way of testing the rooms.Quentin asks everyone about their occupations. He says he is a police officer, Holloway says she is a doctor, and Worth says he works \"in an office building, doing office building stuff.\" Leaven claims simply to \"hang out\" with her friends. Quentin believes that nothing is a coincidence, that each of them has a purpose in the cube. After Holloway talks about her rings and broaches, Quentin asks why Leaven has her glasses, while Holloway has had her jewellery taken away. Leaven reveals herself to excel at mathematics, and after looking at the numbers on a crawlspace, theorizes that when one of those numbers is prime, the room is booby-trapped.Leaven's purpose becomes attempting to \"crack the Cube's code\", and they progress through the cubes.

The film begins with the biblical story as Adam (P\u00e9ter Bocsor) and Eve (J\u00falia M\u00e9r\u00f6), are deceived by Lucifer (Eszter Gyalog) -- three very photogenic leads -- into tasting the \"Forbidden Fruit\". They are thus chased out of the Garden of Eden by the Angel of Death and, in a vision, sent on an existential journey through western European history.Always followed closely and influenced by the deceptively sweet, but contemptuous Lucifer, we follow Adam through The Plague, wars, Byzantium's wretched cripples, the French Revolution, the squalor of Dickensian London, and a final return to the scene of the crucifixion. Of course the picture makes a case for its premise -- that of the consequences of Original Sin -- yet does so in a very unique way. In the closing scene, Lucifer says, \"Why did I strive to achieve greatness in man, who is...in knowlege a pygmy, in blindness a giant?\" This reflects the somewhat nihilistic view of a nation still under the boot of Soviet communism.This rare movie may be one of the best (and only child-starred) art films ever.\n\n", "\n\nAngyali \u00fcdv\u00f6zlet, aka \"The Annunciation\", is a surreal account of the history of humanity as portrayed entirely by children between the ages of 8 and 12.

After Ronnie leaves, Rachel reflects on her adventures during the final days of the war.In 1944, Rachel hides from the Nazis in a farm in the Dutch countryside. In exchange for hiding her, they expect her to learn Bible verses. One day, a crippled Allied bomber drops its payload on the farmhouse, killing everyone except Rachel. Rob (Michiel Heisman), a young man from a neighboring farm, hides her in the family's greenhouse. That night, Van Gein (Peter Blok), a police officer, arrives to tell them that the Nazis know that Rachel is in the area and will hunt her down. He agrees to help Rachel and Rob escape to the Allied controlled southern part of Holland. Rachel visits her father's lawyer, Smaal (Dolf de Vries). He gives her enough money and jewels to live on for a year but warns her not to trust people so easily. Van Gein leads Rachel and Rob to a dock where other Jews wait to leave. Rachel is reunited with her parents and brother, who is recovering from an emergency appendectomy. Van Gein does not accompany the Jews on the boat trip. That evening, the boat is ambushed by a Nazi patrol boat. The Nazis immediately open fire; only Rachel survives the massacre. Before drifting down the river, she sees the Nazis loot the corpses.Rachel is found by Resistance fighters who smuggle her into The Hague by disguising her as a typhoid victim and placing her in a coffin that if properly \"sealed\" has sizable air holes. She is taken to a soup kitchen run by another member of the Resistance, Gerben Kuipers (Derek de Lint) and given the new name of Ellis de Vries. Eventually she is made a part of the Resistance's plans to smuggle in British guns and rations. The smugglers are led by Hans Akkermans (Thom Hoffman), an expert marksman. He and Ellis are to pose as husband and wife so the Nazis will not search their luggage on the train; the luggage is actually full of weaponry. But when the Nazi soldiers on the train clearly do intend to search all baggage, a new plan is needed. Ellis takes the bags and enters a private compartment occupied by SD Colonel M\u00fcntze (Sebastian Koch). The Nazis don't search M\u00fcntze's compartment.

Knowing he is an avid stamp collector, she takes some rare Dutch stamps to him. He invites her to a Nazi party. There she sees SS commandant G\u00fcnter Franken (Waldemar Kobus) and recognizes him as the Nazi who led the ambush against the refugee boat.

There she sees SS commandant G\u00fcnter Franken (Waldemar Kobus) and recognizes him as the Nazi who led the ambush against the refugee boat. Although she is sickened at his sight, she manages to sing at the party later. She and M\u00fcntze return to his suite to make love. He intuits that she is Jewish from her dyed blond hair but has fallen in love with her. She accepts a job in his office and begins work the following day. There she meets Ronnie, who is Franken's secretary/sex partner. Franken gives them a report indicating that Tim has confessed everything and is to be executed, however, M\u00fcntze refuses to sign the execution order.Ellis sees Smaal at Nazi headquarters and learns that he and M\u00fcntze have negotiated a cease fire -- if the Resistance ceases its attacks against the Nazis, the Nazis will cease its violent reprisals against Dutch civilians. However, when a hidden microphone placed by Ellis in Franken's office reveals that Franken and Van Gein have been working together to kill and rob Jews trying to escape into Allied territory, a controversy amongst the Resistance fighters ensues.

Ryu tries to donate one of his kidneys to his sister but is told that his blood type does not match that of his sister and so is not a suitable donor. After being laid off from his job by the factory boss, Ryu contacts a black market organ dealer who agrees to sell him a kidney suitable for his sister in exchange for 10,000,000 Korean won, plus one of Ryu's own kidneys. He takes the severance pay from his factory job and offers the money to the organ dealers, who take the money and one of his kidneys, but then disappear. Three weeks later, Ryu learns from his doctor that a kidney has been found for his sister and that the operation will cost 10,000,000 won, but since the organ dealers stole his money, he will not be able to pay for it.In need of money for the operation and in retaliation for his being fired, Ryu and his girlfriend, Yeong-mi (Doona Bae), a radical anarchist, conspire to kidnap the daughter of the boss who fired him. Instead, he realizes that the kidnapping would immediately put them under police suspicion, and they decide to kidnap Yu-sun (Bo-bae Han), the daughter of the boss's friend, Park Dong-jin (Kang-ho Song), another factory executive. The girl stays with Ryu's sister (thinking that Ryu is merely babysitting for a time), who takes care of her while the distraught Dong-jin arranges to pay her ransom. After Ryu collects the money and returns home, he learns that his sister has discovered his scheme and, unwilling to be involved or burden Ryu further, killed herself. Ryu takes Yu-sun and his sister's body into the countryside to bury her by a riverbed they used to frequent as children. While Ryu mourns, Yu-sun accidentally slips into the river and drowns.Days later, as Dong-jin mourns his daughter and swears revenge at the river bank, Ryu ambushes and murders the organ dealers. Dong-jin, having investigated the identities of the kidnappers, finds Yeong-mi and begins interrogating her. Yeong-mi apologizes for Yu-sun's death but warns him of her membership in a terrorist organization that, knowing Dong-jin's identity, will kill him if she dies. Dong-jin, unfazed by the threats, tortures her to death by electrocuting her. Ryu returns to Yeong-mi's apartment building and discovers the police removing her body on a stretcher. Ryu, consumed with grief, swears vengeance on Dong-jin.Ryu arrives at Dong-jin's residence in an attempt to kill him. He waits for some time, but Dong-Jin does not arrive: he is, in fact, waiting at Ryu's apartment. After Dong-Jin does not arrive, Ryu returns to his apartment. However, Dong-jin had previously set up an electric booby trap on his doorknob, which renders Ryu unconscious. Dong-jin then binds Ryu and returns him to the riverbed where Yu-sun died. After binding Ryu's hands and feet and bringing him chest-high into the water, an emotional Dong-jin acknowledges that although Ryu is a good man, he has no choice; Dong-jin then slashes Ryu's Achilles tendons, resulting in his drowning.Dong-jin drags Ryu back to shore and then drives off to a desolate location to bury the body. Once there, he begins to dig a hole, but soon a group of men arrives. They surround and stab Dong-jin repeatedly, finally attaching a note to his chest identifying themselves as the terrorist group of which Yeong-mi was part.

Ryu tries to donate one of his kidneys to his sister but is told that his blood type does not match that of his sister and so is not a suitable donor. After being laid off from his job by the factory boss, Ryu contacts a black market organ dealer who agrees to sell him a kidney suitable for his sister in exchange for 10,000,000 Korean won, plus one of Ryu's own kidneys. He takes the severance pay from his factory job and offers the money to the organ dealers, who take the money and one of his kidneys, but then disappear. Three weeks later, Ryu learns from his doctor that a kidney has been found for his sister and that the operation will cost 10,000,000 won, but since the organ dealers stole his money, he will not be able to pay for it.In need of money for the operation and in retaliation for his being fired, Ryu and his girlfriend, Yeong-mi (Doona Bae), a radical anarchist, conspire to kidnap the daughter of the boss who fired him. Instead, he realizes that the kidnapping would immediately put them under police suspicion, and they decide to kidnap Yu-sun (Bo-bae Han), the daughter of the boss's friend, Park Dong-jin (Kang-ho Song), another factory executive. The girl stays with Ryu's sister (thinking that Ryu is merely babysitting for a time), who takes care of her while the distraught Dong-jin arranges to pay her ransom.

In the meantime, Hasumi finds out about art teacher Kume's sexual relationship with a male student; he blackmails Kume into lending him his luxury apartment. Hasumi later takes Miya to the apartment and the two have sex. Hasumi presses Miya into giving him access to an online private discussion board that his students use, anonymously making claims about the murder of Rina's father, accusing delinquent student Tadenuma, who had targeted Rina online previously.

He graduates from Harvard University with an MBA, and works at Morgenstern, a European investment bank, for two years. Hasumi returns to Japan to pursue high school teaching. However, his outward charm masks his true nature. In reality, Hasumi is a sociopath who is unable to feel empathy for other human beings. Specifically, he has a severe antisocial personality disorder. Having killed both of his parents and his former tutor at the age of fourteen, Hasumi turns into a fiendishly clever killer.

Upon collecting all of the students' cell phones prior to their exams, Hasumi secretly uses a cell phone jammer to completely prevent any cheating during the test. The group of students that had cheated on previous exams became suspicious after none of the group's cell phones have service during the test and immediately suspect the adviser of the Radio Club, Tsurii - a loner Physics teacher.

Someone has replaced the bottles of water he kept around his house to scare off cats with kerosene, as the man is a chainsmoker the bottles soon catch fire and explode. Tsurii soon meets with the intelligent ringleader of the cheating group, Keisuke, revealing his suspicions of Hasumi. Tsurii explains he has dug into Hasumi's past and found strange details, such as at another school where Hasumi started his teaching career that later had four student suicides. During this time, however, Hasumi had bugged the room and learned of Tsurii's suspicion, and confronts him on a train, murdering him and making his death appear as a hanging suicide. Hasumi then confronts Keisuke after the announcement of Tsurii's suicide causes him to panic. Hasumi knocks Keisuke out and ties him up until the end of school, after which Hasumi tortures him into admitting that he and his friends were indeed cheating. Hasumi checks that Keisuke didn't tell others of Tsurii's suspicions, before killing him and hiding his body.\nDuring the same time period, Hasumi is brought to the attention of a blackmail case from one of his students.

The police arrive at the apartment in time only to discover a woman (Jasmina Ilic) sprawled on the floor with her throat sliced open and the corpse of her daughter (Teodora Uveric) stuffed in the chimney. Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) is called to assist in the investigation and discovers that the crime resembles a fictional murder in the short story The Murders in the Rue Morgue, which is part of a collection of stories penned by the writer Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusak).Poe has become a social pariah and penniless drunkard whose stories have not been circulated for some time. He has fallen in love with the beautiful young Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve) and desires to marry her but faces opposition from her father Captain Charles Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson), a military man who loathes Poe and goes to the length of threatening physical violence. Poe is brought to see Fields for questioning and is horrified to learn someone is using his stories as the backdrop for a series of murders. Fields then proposes that Poe volunteer his services to help the police catch the killer and Poe agrees to the task.The two men are called to investigate the murder of literary critic Rufus Griswold (John Warnaby), the man who became Poe's rival after a feud that was published in the Baltimore newspapers. Poe realizes the gruesome crime resembles a scene from The Pit and the Pendulum as Fields notices a red demon mask near the corpse. The two then deduce that the scene of the next crime will take place at Captain Hamilton's annual masquerade ball  a scene that will resemble the Masked Ball in The Masque of the Red Death.Fields assigns several members of the Baltimore Police to go undercover as guests at the Masked Ball. Sometime before midnight, at the height of the festivities, a man on horseback dressed in a skeleton costume appears. Fields shoots the man only to learn he was an actor hired for the entertainment and receives an anonymous note. Poe then realizes Emily has been kidnapped, meaning the event was all a distraction. It's revealed in the killer's note that he will continue to commit murders and leave clues to Emily's location. The killer then threatens to kill Emily if Poe does not start writing columns for the newspaper that describe the brutal combination of fact and fiction  forcing Poe to comply with the request in order to save Emily.The local Medical School's anatomy class discovers a live raven and the corpse of a prostitute in theatrical clothing. Poe and Fields investigate and deduce the scene resembles The Mystery of Marie Rog\u00eat except for one detail  the blood on the corpse's hands was not an element of Poe's story. The two soon learn the woman was an actress (Ana Sofrenovic) in costume as Lady Macbeth and rush to the theatre where the victim worked, demanding to see all the stage hands. All the stage hands are accounted for except for Maurice Rabichaux (Dejan Cubrilov), a sailor on leave after his ship landed in Baltimore. Poe and Fields notice a mysterious figure running along the catwalks and pursue him but the figure escapes. Fields later makes an off-handed comment that the name of the ship Maurice arrived on is the Fortunato  which prompts Poe to realize the next murder will resemble The Cask of Amontillado.Poe and Fields search tunnels under the city with several policemen and discover an area with fresh brickwork, an area that might be where Emily is being held. The officers smash through the brick and discover what appears to be a woman with blonde hair in the costume Emily wore the night she was kidnapped. But the body is revealed to be that of the sailor Maurice, who was dressed to resemble Emily after he was killed and buried in the niche.\nTwo clues are found on Maurice: a pocket watch that was stopped at 12:27 and then stuffed into his mouth, and a tattoo on his back that had some flesh carved out of it. Poe and Fields deduce these clues will give the location of Emily, and Poe realizes a church in Baltimore called Holy Cross is where Emily ", "\n\nThe film opens in 19th century Maryland  where several Baltimore policemen are chasing after the screams of a woman in an apartment.

Stubby's cell-mates are Emmanuelle 'Bunny' O'Neill (Lynne Frederick) a young prostitute; Bud (Harry Baird), a mentally disturbed black man who is obsessed with the dead; and Clem (Michael J. Pollard), the town drunkard. During the night, a masked posse of men wreck havoc throughout the settlement. Fearing for their safety as the massacre progresses, the prisoners demand to be realeased, but the sheriff refuses. The following morning, the sheriff, amused by Stubby's ways, allows them to leave town, pointing them to an abandoned wagon as their means of transportation. The sheriff also tells them that the massacre was all his idea to reclaim the town from lawlessness.The four released convicts decide to travel together, and Stubby takes a liking to Bunny. As they travel, aiming to his the next big town over 200 miles away, a friendship develops between the four reprobates. During their first stop for the night, Bunny reveals that she's eight months pregnant, having gotten knocked up by a client in Salt Flat and has been hiding it with oversized dresses. The following day, the four have an encounter with a group of Christian missionaries from Switzerland where Stubby has Bunny pose as his wife, who's happy about the charade.Afterwards, the four's idyll is interrupted by appearance of a Mexican sharpshooter called Chaco (Tomas Milian). Despite initial suspicious, he is welcomed into the group. Chaco displays his shooting skills by shooting rabbits and ducks for their meal for the night. But he shows a sinister side when the group is attacked by three posse members from Salt Flat, and Chaco gleefully shoots all three of them, and sadistically tortures the one surviving posse member. That evening, Chaco persuades the group to take peyote with him. Stubby, secretly spits out the hallucinogenic cactus, suspicious alerted, but the rest of the party accepts. Chaco then amuses himself with Clem, humiliating the drug-addled alcoholic by ordering that he crawl and bark like a dog for some liquor. When Stubby attempts to make a run for it, Chaco subdues him and ties up the four travelers at gunpoint. As day breaks, Chaco rapes Bunny despite seeing her condition. Stubby swears to kill Chaco one day if he survives. The evil bandit then rides off on the wagon with all their gear, leaving them tied up in the desert, except for Clem who he shoots in the leg. Clem frees the others and they continue their trek on foot. As Clems wound worsens, Stubby is forced to remove the bullet and he and Bud carry him on a makeshift stretcher. Later, the group comes upon the aftermath of another attack by Chaco and two henchmen. The Christian wagoners, children and all, have all been slaughtered.The group's journey continues.

Stopping for ", "\n\nThe Men in Black are a secret law-enforcement agency that is responsible for policing the extraterrestrial life hidden on Earth, as well as protecting the world from any aliens who attempt to destroy/invade the planet.The film begins on LunarMax, a MiB prison situated on the moon. A one-armed criminal, a Boglodite named Boris the Animal, stages a jailbreak (along the way killing Obadiah Price, a fellow inmate he'd made a deal with). His intention is to rewrite history, with Agent K, the one who arrested and imprisoned him, being a major factor in his plan...On Earth, Agent K and his partner Agent J cover up an arrival of an alien spacecraft, and hear of the prison break. At a Chinese restaurant thats a local haunt for aliens, Agent K discovers Boris (who had previously gone to see Obadiah's son Jeffrey) and the two fight, with J joining in. K is upset that the alien he should have killed is out loose again; he deems it his own affair and forbids J to help him, suspending him. A puzzled J checks up on Boris: he appeared in 1969 to stop the prevention of the ArcNet Shield, a device that K deployed to protect the world from harm (but which killed off the Boglodites, as they can only survive by feeding off worlds). He managed to kill on 15 July 1969 an alien named Roman the Fabulous and on the following day... at this point O cuts him off and tells him not to investigate any further. That night, as K waits for Boris with a gun in his hand, he suddenly vanishes...The next morning, J discovers that he has a new partner, the liberated Agent AA, and that K has been dead for forty years (having been killed by Boris the Animal on 16th July 1969). O notices he is suffering from headaches and craves chocolate milk, which she explains are symptoms of time-fracture (aka the crime of interfering with history, which Obadiah Price was imprisoned for). At this point a Boglodite armada appears; J learns that there was nothing to hold them at bay, with no K to deploy the ArcNet. He theorizes that Boris went back in time to 1969 to kill K, thus changing history to what it was, and proposes to follow him; he heads to Jeffrey Price, who had provided Boris a time-jump device, and gets another one from him, and activates it by jumping off the Chrysler Building just as the Boglodites begin their assault...J arrives in 15 July 1969, with the intention to catch Boris as he is about to murder Roman the Fabulous. However, he is delayed from navigating the era of 1969 (most notably by an altercation with two racist cops), and gets there too late to stop Romans murder by 1969 Boris.

At this point a Boglodite armada appears; J learns that there was nothing to hold them at bay, with no K to deploy the ArcNet. He theorizes that Boris went back in time to 1969 to kill K, thus changing history to what it was, and proposes to follow him; he heads to Jeffrey Price, who had provided Boris a time-jump device, and gets another one from him, and activates it by jumping off the Chrysler Building just as the Boglodites begin their assault...J arrives in 15 July 1969, with the intention to catch Boris as he is about to murder Roman the Fabulous. However, he is delayed from navigating the era of 1969 (most notably by an altercation with two racist cops), and gets there too late to stop Romans murder by 1969 Boris. He encounters 1969 Agent K, who subdues him and brings him to MiB headquarters. J tells K nothing, but when threatened with getting his memory erased he tells K part of the truth: he came from the future in pursuit of another time-traveler whos trying to change history.K and J follow a trail of clues to Andy Warhols Factory complex, where Warhol is revealed to be MiB Agent W. He notifies them of Griffin, an Arcanian being who has the ability to foresee all timelines and futures; Griffins planet was destroyed by the Boglodites, so he came to live on Earth and brought with him a device which will prevent the Boglodites from consuming the Earth. 1969 Boris arrives at the Factory in search of Griffin, who makes a quick exit with Boris in fast pursuit (to Js displeasure, although K doesnt seem to get too worried).J and K eventually track down Griffin at Shea Stadium, where he is foreseeing the future victory for the Mets baseball team. 1969 Boris appears and captures Griffin, but J and K are able to rescue Griffin, although Boris gets away. Griffin gives them the ArcNet and explains it can only work in zero gravity: K gets the idea to head to Cape Canaveral on 16th July 1969 (the day the Apollo 11 ship launched)", "\n\nThe film starts with a brief recollection of the \"Killing Angel\", a dangerous assassin that has been operating in most of southeast Asia. The Killing Angel has no known accomplices or colleagues, is not affiliated with any government, religious, or criminal organization, and to this date their true identity has still remained secret. The Killing Angel is believed to be responsible for 6 murders in the past year alone, with only one thing connecting each of the assassinations - all the victims were criminals and deserved to die.Then the movie quickly moves on to the Killing Angel's most recent killing, the well-publicized assassination of a notorious ex-yakuza crime boss. Working swiftly, the Killing Angel is able to overcome the criminal's defense systems, quickly incapacitating the boss's bodyguards and isolating his target. In a fit of desperation, the crime boss promises to triple whatever fee the Killing Angel is being paid to kill him, then goes on to warn the vigilante that there is a massive revenge fund set to avenge his killing. Ignoring his pleas, the Killing Angel silently kills the crime boss.The scene then switches over to the story of Fu (Jet Li), a small-town gang member who lives an extremely simple and modest lifestyle, albeit being a contract killer. It is revealed that Fu is very kind and has trouble killing innocent people, a trait that causes him to be disliked by the other low-rent triad members. When Fu's boss reveals that there is now a $100 million US bounty on the Killing Angel's head for the slaying of the yakuza boss, Fu is quick to volunteer for the job, but is instead insulted.Fu then attempts to enter the building where the crime boss's lawyers are discussing the terms for the revenge fund, but is detained at the entrance and ushered out by security guards. In a surprisingly quick sequence, Fu defends himself by rapidly incapacitating each of the guards. His lightning-swift martial arts skills draw the attention of Ngok Lo, played by Eric Tsang, a seedy contract booker and loan shark, who comes to Fu's aid by pretending that he is an agent and Fu is his actor. Thanks to Lo's smooth talking, the pair is able to sidle into the meeting.The meeting however, comes to a halt when government agents, led by detective Chan (Simon Yam), raid the building in search of known criminals who are meeting there. Chan, a leading detective, has been working tirelessly to expose the Killing Angel's true identity for years. The movie then switches over to another sequence, where the character of Eiji Tsukamoto, the slain crime boss's grandson, played by Renji Sato, is introduced. Tsukamoto, fed up with his grandfather's cowardice in life, now seeks his grandfather's power in death. Tsukamoto consumes a portion of his grandfather's cremated ashes, an act that causes the deceased lord's top aid to call him insane, but now all of the family's agents and gang members serve Tsukamoto as their new master.Fu and Lo get to know each other - Fu is an ex-soldier from mainland China, part of a special, world-famous unit known as the \"Golden Soldiers\". When Lo asks for a demonstration of Fu's skills, he is able to rapidly take down several ruffians simultaneously, but falters when he is confronted by a woman. Lo then explains the deal with Fu, and they head for an amusement park to assassinate the first person believed to be the Killing Angel. However, when they get there, it is revealed their target is a simple family man, and instead of killing him, Fu saves his life by killing his other assassins, the low-rank triad members he formerly lived with.Fu and Lo are then arrested, but they are bailed out by Lo's daughter, Kiki (Gigi Leung), an intelligent and successful lawyer fed up with her father's scandalous ways and criminal connections. Fu moves in with Lo now that he has no place to stay, and they quickly become friends, Lo claiming he used to be an infamous hitman known ", "\n\nThe film starts with a brief recollection of the \"Killing Angel\", a dangerous assassin that has been operating in most of southeast Asia.

One day, Pongo sets his eyes on a beautiful female dalmatian named Perdita. After a frantic chase through the streets and into St. James's Park, Roger and Pongo discover that Perdita likes Pongo. Her owner, Anita Campbell-Green (Joely Richardson), falls in love with Roger when they meet. After they both end up falling into the lake as a result of their dogs, they return to Roger's home, and Anita accepts his proposal. They get married along with Perdita and Pongo.\nAnita works as a fashion designer at the House of de Vil. Her boss, the pampered and very glamorous Cruella de Vil (Glenn Close) has a deep passion for fur, going so far as to have a taxidermist, Mr. Skinner, skin a white tiger at the London Zoo to make into a rug for her. Anita, inspired by her dalmatian, designs a coat made with spotted fur. Cruella is intrigued by the idea of making garments out of actual dalmatians and finds it amusing that it would seem as if she was wearing Anita's dog.\nAnita soon discovers that Perdita is pregnant, and is then informed that she is too, much to her shock. Some time later, Cruella visits their home, and expresses contempt upon meeting Roger. Her initial disgust at them having a baby turns to excitement when she finds out Perdita is expecting too. Several weeks later, she returns when a litter of 15 puppies are born and offers Roger and Anita \u00c2\u00a37,500 for them, but they refuse. She dismisses Anita and vows revenge against her and Roger. She has her henchmen, Jasper and Horace (Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams) break into their home and steal the puppies while Roger and Anita are gone for a walk at the park taking Pongo and Perdita with them. Along with 84 others that were previously stolen, they deliver them to her ancient country estate, De Vil Mansion. She also hires Mr. Skinner to kill and skin them to create her coat.\nWith the family devastated at the loss of their puppies, Pongo uses the Twilight bark to carry the message via the dogs and animals of London, while Roger and Anita notify the Metropolitan Police Service. A dog who had witnessed the stolen puppies follows Jasper and Horace to the mansion, and finds all of them inside before helping them escape under the duo's noses. They make their way to a nearby farm, where they are later joined by Pongo and Perdita. Cruella arrives at the mansion and soon discovers what has happened. Furious, she decides to carry out the job herself, whilst Jasper and Horace attempt to search for them also.\nAfter several mishaps, Jasper and Horace discover nearby police on the hunt for Cruella and her henchmen and hand themselves in, joining Mr. Skinner who was beaten earlier while trying to kill Lucky, who had been left behind. Meanwhile, Cruella tracks the puppies to the farm where they are hiding and tries to retrieve them. However, they outwit her and cause her to fall into a vat of molasses and get thrown through a window into a pigpen. Shortly after, the fleeing dalmatians (including Lucky) are found and sent home via the Suffolk Constabulary, while those looking for Cruella arrive at the farm to arrest her. In the police van, she belittles Jasper, Horace, and Skinner for their incompetence before they are sprayed by a skunk which she had mistaken for her bag. Pongo, Perdita, and their puppies are reunited with Roger and Anita. After being informed that the remaining 84 puppies have no home to go to since they have not been claimed, they decide to adopt them, bringing the total to 101.

She explains that she has been planning three years to rescue her fianc\u00e9e, Bruce Barton, whose airplane crashed in the area. The Governor asks about her colleagues and their reasons for helping. Despite her best efforts, the Governor is adamant--the answer is no. To make sure his orders are followed he tells her he will place a police escort on the plane.

They are waiting for Susan to return from her meeting with the Governor. Susan arrives and joins them at the table. They ask how things went. She responds, \"I couldn't do a thing with the Governor.\" Lee doesn't think there will be any problems. He has a plan for the security escort. They drive out to the landing strip and are met by a policeman (Manuel Lopez). Lee gets in the airplane and starts the engine. It would appear that Marty will stay behind as Russ and Susan board the plane. Marty lures the policeman away from the plane, a Stinson Voyager, and then decks him and boards.

The CIA learns that its asset Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) has been captured trying to free a Briton, Elizabeth Hadley (Catherine McCormack), from a People's Liberation Army prison in Su Chou near Shanghai, China. Bishop is being questioned under torture and will be executed in 24 hours unless the U.S. government claims him. If the CIA claims Bishop as an agent, they risk jeopardizing the trade agreement. Exacerbating Bishop's situation is the fact that he was operating without permission from the Agency.\nAttempting to deal quickly with the situation, CIA executives call in Nathan Muir (Robert Redford), an aging mid-level case officer on his last day before retirement and the man who recruited Bishop. Although they tell Muir they simply need him to act as a \"stop gap\" to fill in some holes in their background files, the officials are hoping he will give them the pretext they need to justify letting Bishop die. The CIA executives are unaware that Muir had been tipped off about Bishop's capture prior to arriving at the CIA's headquarters, by fellow CIA veteran Harry Duncan (David Hemmings), for whom Bishop had been working an operation in Hong Kong before going rogue. Muir first attempts to save Bishop by leaking the story to CNN through a contact in Hong Kong, believing that public pressure would force the CIA to rescue Bishop. The tactic only stalls them, however, and is stymied when a phone call to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission from CIA Deputy Director Charles Harker (Stephen Dillane) results in CNN retracting the story.\nDuring the debriefing, Muir describes how he recruited Bishop for an operation when Bishop was a U.S. Marine scout sniper during the Vietnam War. Muir also discusses their 1976 tour of duty in Berlin, Germany, where Bishop was tasked with procuring East German assets, with Muir commanding, as well as Bishop's spy work in Beirut, Lebanon in 1985 during the War of the Camps, the latter being the last time the two saw each other. During the mission in Lebanon, Bishop met Hadley, and the two began developing romantic feelings for each other. However, it is revealed that Hadley was involved in a bombing of the Chinese embassy in Britain, causing her to flee the country. Fearing that Bishop's feelings for Hadley might compromise his cover and the mission, Muir tips off the Chinese to Hadley's location in return for freeing an arrested U.S. diplomat. Chinese agents kidnap Hadley, and Bishop cuts all ties to Muir when he discovers his involvement. After learning Hadley was the target of Bishop's rescue attempt, Muir finally realizes that he has greatly underestimated Bishop's feelings for her.\nRunning out of time, Muir secretly creates a forged urgent operational directive from the CIA director to commence Operation Dinner Out, a rescue mission to be spearheaded by Commander Wiley's (Dale Dye) U.S. Navy SEAL team, for which Bishop had laid the groundwork as a \"Plan B\" for his own rescue attempt. Using US$282,000 of his life savings and a misappropriated file on Chinese coastline satellite imagery, Muir enlists Duncan's help in bribing a Chinese energy official to cut power to the prison for 30 minutes, during which time the SEAL rescue team retrieves Bishop and Hadley.\nBishop, who is rescued at the end of the film 15 minutes before his scheduled execution, realizes Muir was behind his rescue when he recognizes the name of the plan to rescue him, Operation Dinner Out: a reference to a birthday gift that Bishop gave Muir while they were in Lebanon.

You brought the money!\" Courtland now realizes for the first time who Sandra really is, and father and daughter fall into a deep embrace.\n", "\n\nAs elderly people go about their day in Manhattan, Harry walks along a sidewalk with his tabby cat Tonto on a leash, quoting Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" as he goes. Harry stops in at a grocer, buys some good food for his cat, and jokes that his sexual days are over.Next Harry meets his old friend Jacob on a bench, and tells him that his apartment building is being torn down to build a parking lot. Jacob complains about capitalists, and reassures Harry that he could always move in with him.On the way home, a kid tries to steal Harry's groceries and knocks him down. Harry is helped up by Leroy, his building super.Harry gets into his apartment and talks to Tonto, lamenting that he's been mugged four times in the past year, and that the whole city is getting run down.Some time later, police show up to forcibly remove Harry and his furniture from the building. Harry continues to spout \"King Lear\" while his son Burt arrives to pick him up.Harry goes to live with Burt and his wife and two grown sons in the suburbs. His younger grandson, Norman, has taken a vow of silence, leading to obvious tension with his brother and parents. Harry later asks Norman for the books that explain his beliefs.Harry goes back to his familiar bench to talk with Jacob, and they both agree it's been a long time since either has been with a woman. Jacob reminisces about his first sexual encounter with a servant girl when he was 14.Harry invites Leroy to dinner at Burt's house, and he plays the piano while Leroy dances to the tune. Leroy later comments that he lives with his 90-year-old mother and can't find a new job, which leads Burt's wife to question why Harry is not getting help from his two other kids.Knowing that he is a burden to Burt, Harry goes to look for his own apartment, but finds that the place he wants will not take cats. He then tells Burt he is going to Chicago to visit Shirley, Burt's sister, but before he leaves he stops at a city morgue to identify the body of Jacob, who has died with no relatives. Harry cries after recalling Jacob's story of losing his virginity.Burt takes Harry to the airport, but Harry soon learns that he can't go through security with Tonto, so he takes a cab to get a bus. Along the route, Harry asks the bus driver to stop so that Tonto can relieve himself, whereupon the cat runs away across a cemetery. The bus driver leaves Harry behind with his luggage, and when Tonto returns, Harry scolds him.Harry walks to a used car lot and buys an old Chevy for $250. He then checks into a motel and calls Burt to tell him what has happened, realizing in the process that his driver's license expired in 1958.Harry drives west rather slowly, with Tonto on the dashboard, recalling how he wanted to drive across the country when he was younger, but his wife and kids came along. He remembers they had many good times though. He confesses to Tonto that he has a great fear of pain, and that when he dies he would like to go quickly rather than the slow way his wife Annie died.Harry picks up two young hitchhikers, one of whom soon gets another ride, while the other a girl named Ginger continues west with Harry. She claims she is 16, and is running away from home to a commune in Boulder.Harry and Ginger get a motel for the night, and after she comes out of the bathroom half-naked, Harry is prompted to recall the first girl he loved, Jessie, whom he has not seen in 50 years. Ginger suggests that they go to see her, even though it's out of their way, and they eventually find her in a nursing home.At first Harry thinks Jessie remembers him, but her thoughts are marked by senility; she calls him Alex yet remembers his wife Annie. Then she suddenly asks Harry to dance, which they do while Ginger looks on.Harry ", "\n\nAs elderly people go about their day in Manhattan, Harry walks along a sidewalk with his tabby cat Tonto on a leash, quoting Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" as he goes.
